I guess we got one other journalist. No. America first. Yes. Ford, we love you. That's Ford. Yes. Oh. Look how not very happy I'm here. Who cares? How come Ford didn't come to come here? Why didn't he tell me to come to this? Isn't that mean? Shh. Nobody would like to talk when we ask to talk. I'm going to steal it. You have a lot of branches. Ford, why didn't you tell me this was happening? For backup. Oh my gosh. We should be working together and helping each other. I'm going to steal it. I'm going to steal it. Now I don't know what the rules are. Oh my gosh, I have to run around this? What am I supposed to do? Be careful not to trip. Oh my gosh, they're going to make me run around this? Actually, that's a better view. It's a better view. Oh, they fenced us all in. Oh my gosh, they got us all in fences. Well, this makes it very difficult for media. Exactly. This is what they do to media. This is communism. We have to wait until the end of it. How are we supposed to cover this? We can't. We're in communism. Yeah. We can't cover it. Media doesn't care. Good night. We love you guys. Oh my gosh, Karen. Just follow me, back me up. We live in communism. The media is not allowed to cover anything. Watch this. First Amendment only. That's all you said. Okay. It's not okay that we have got all these fences. We're getting stuck in them. We're supposed to have freedom of the press. We don't. These guys have to stand up. Thank you. Yeah, watch out. Jeez, thanks. Okay, thank you. Thank you. I'm going to cover you with that. I need you to do that. I need you to do that. I need you to do that. Tear down. Slow it down. Slow it down. I'm lost. Fuck you. I'm lost. Fuck you. I'm lost. I'm lost. Fuck you. I'm lost. I'm lost. Go home and die. Go home and die. Go home and die. Fucking scum. You see a woman died. Let's go. Go home and die. I'm wearing leopard print pants, and now I am. Go home and die. Both sides shield. Driver's axle. Be careful. Be careful here. I can only go to my battery's run off. I can only go to my battery's run off. Go home and die. No problem. Put your hat on front. Put your hat on front, please. There's a gentleman. Go home and die. Beautiful. This is true America. Standing up for what they believe in. Everyone has the right to do that. Stand up for what you believe in. Oh my gosh, what was that? The police are being aggressive. The police are being dangerous, not the protesters. Protesters are peaceful. This is what America was founded on. Standing up for what you believe in. I'm independent media. I have no opinion. I'm neutral. I'm just showing you what's happening in your city, county, and on the federal level. Washington, D.C. December 4th, 2021. I don't have the proper equipment to cover all this. So y'all better start donating and taking me seriously. Because I'm ready to cover everything. I really love seeing all the American flags. You guys know my dog is the American Revolution. My family is from Pennsylvania and we have to stand up for freedom. We do not want to live in communism where the media is censored every single day in a new and different way. This is for all the mothers so that their daughters can be free. So we're crossing the bridge in the Virginia. I'm not wearing any shoes. This is like last December. These people are totally respectful to me. No one's been violent. There's no violence here. It's totally peaceful. Except the police are pushing us around too much and we're independent media and we have the right to be here. I was not prepared for this. And that's why you guys care about what's happening in your city, county, and state on the federal level. You really need to be way more supportive for independent media. Because there's no ABC, NBC, CBS. There's no news covering us. And these protesters, these men, are being really kind. The police are being stressful. They're violating the First Amendment. The police are. Protesters have the right to protest. No matter what group you're with, you have the right to protest. And after what I've seen in Washington DC in the last month is that we have no First Amendment. We have no freedom of the press. Very important to stand up for independent media. There is no ABC, NBC, CBS. Nobody's covering us. They're too scared. And what are they scared of? To show that America is divided right now? Because we have a president that doesn't even work? He has no schedule today? The president has no schedule today. I don't want a president that doesn't have a schedule. Come on. Let's be honest. Let's be honest. This better be on Rumble. This better be on all my channels. This better be on Telegram. Every single channel I have because I'm independent media. Who, what, where, when, why, how? Do not violate my First Amendment. Freedom of the press. This guy's like on a bicycle. He doesn't care. I need battery packs. I need everything. I'm not going to do an RV. I'm going to show you what's happening. So you understand that America is divided right now. And I'm grateful to be here and I'm grateful that the people protesting right now are so kind. I don't know what they believe in because no one will tell me. But what we believe in is freedom of the press. Please archive this footage because I get banned everywhere. Whoever's out there listening to this, freedom of the press, turn your cameras on. Document history of the United States of America. December 4th, 2021, Washington, D.C. Crossing the Arlington Bridge. What am I crossing right now? We're going into Virginia. We're going into Virginia. We're going into Virginia. We're going into Virginia. We're going into Virginia. We're going into Virginia. We're going into Virginia. You guys told me it's dark in Virginia. You got what you wanted. Put your hat the other way. No, these aren't for girls. Put your hat the other way. Are they different from people who I don't know? Yeah, they're different. Go ask your journalist. Who, what, where, when, why, how? Go ask. Because they think I'm a journalist. That's not true. You were talking. I can't talk right now. Okay, no talking. No talking on the phone. This is ridiculous. You were praying for this. You got what you wanted. You were suicidal. You just thought you were in heaven. You got what you wanted. And now you're complaining. What am I complaining about? Nothing. I love you. Thank you for bodyguarding me. I need a bodyguard. Now you can see. If you guys haven't been here, woo! Get your DC's for America. Thank you. He's a big peep. He wouldn't be here if he said that. Someone archive this footage. All my moderators, if anybody's out there, you better archive this. Place it everywhere. Because this is a moment in history where people are standing up for what they believe in. We don't know what they believe in right now, but... They're really respectful to me. They're really respectful to me. No fake news. In every city there's over 100 Melissa's. Of different races, ethnicities. And in the end, people who believe in freedom, American patriots, have to stand united, not divided. Daughters of the American Revolution, it's time for us to be united, not divided. Our First Amendment doesn't exist in the United States anymore. Your freedom to assemble, your freedom to press. America, make America great again. Nothing to do with Trump. Trump has nothing to do with this. I'm not going to be a part of this. I'm not going to be a part of this. I'm not going to be a part of this. Nothing to do with Trump. Trump has nothing to do with this. Trump's over. This is about your freedom to say and do and be and think whatever you believe in. This is the United States of America. It's about your... Okay, so we might have to cross. See, I don't know what the rules are anymore with all this stuff. We're going to go in the middle. I know. When I was in school, they don't give us all these rules, so nobody knows what the rules are. We're allowed to be on public places. Okay, let's go in the public place. Yeah, I know. You guys, I think I have to go over there because I'm media. We have to go on that side. Stop. Stop. Stop. I'm media. This is my bodyguard. I'm media."

I'm in the most dangerous protest I've ever been in, so watch this and tell me what works and what doesn't. I'm serious. This is the most dangerous protest I've ever been in. Okay, call me back. I'll give you a call. I'm in the most dangerous protest I've ever been in. Hello? Do you guys know what this protest is for or against? It says, Reclaim America, so I don't know what that means. Okay. We don't think we sold it. We would not take our cause with your treacherous lack of conviction. Now and then, the pirates of the Pacific would say we'll deny you. Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! The man between our marching ranks is savage! America is free between the first warriors of patriotism! And when we die, we take our place and put up a new kind of liberty, standard to all people. What is that? What is that? I don't know. I think it's a state policy statement. But of all people, it's yours only, you. Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! Every day! Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! Fuck you fascists! On and on, they speak of democracy. They can't practice what they preach, as we do.

For the future of America! For the freedom of our nation! Why must we be slaves? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation? kill and ruin our nation?

Be happy. We're waiting. We were waiting for American Patriots to come back to D.C. I just don't know if these are federal agents. Or if they're real or fake. We don't know anything. That's the problem. I have no idea what's going on most of the time. So if there's sandbags all over here and there's American Patriots second D.C. jail without bail. Then that's unacceptable behavior. And I have no night time wedding. That's your guys' fault. They're not donating enough to make sure I'm safe. But I have two bodyguards. I think they're the only independent media out there. Exactly. So just back me up a little bit. Richard is missing out like crazy. I know. Richard is not covering anything. He's gonna take my footage. Richard, you took my footage. You better give me credit now. I'm the one wandering the streets of D.C. Exhausted. Getting banned everywhere for I don't know why. There was no night time wedding. I'm surprised to see this level of competence. That explains why the police and the helicopters and everything have been so crazy. Can you guys ask them questions and ask them what they're doing and help me be journalists? Who would wear a white hat? Professor, can you help me ask questions? Professor. Professor, they don't like to talk to women. Can you help me ask questions? Who would wear a white hat? The guy in the cowboy hat. They don't like, they don't respect women. I love them, but they don't respect women. I love every protester in America. I love people with passion for anything. I love people who are willing to do anything. I love every protester in America. I love people with passion for anything. Can you ask them where they're from? Hello! They don't respect me. Can you be a journalist and ask who would wear a white hat? I feel like we're going to come to a stop and then we can ask them that. Okay. I'll probably run out of battery. The one time I didn't expect this. It's happening. Hey, hey, hey, this way. This way. Someone screenshot it. We all got a little bit of everything. Bye. Hello, hey guys. Hello. Hello. Probably almost everyone who walked past yells at them. It's sad. Back me up. See, look how friendly they were. Oh my God. Were your security go? I have my press passes. Yeah, we're not going to let you get away. Don't leave me. I have that security with me. You need double security. I got my press pass. We're sad. I just don't have good lighting. Yeah. And I don't have any shoes on. Can you believe this? Oh my goodness, you're right. How do I know? You don't have any socks? This happened to me last time when we were following the project. What? I don't see any socks. Not socks. This is a really bad accident. I don't see any. Men don't have a shield. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Yeah, I would like to get a sense of what they actually stand for, what they actually want, etc. Probably it is different from what they're portrayed as. Step. Step. Go. Watch the trees! Watch the trees! Trees! The flag is crossed. Watch the trees! Trees! Trees! Trees! Trees! On the right! Trees! Trees! Oh yeah. I don't know. We saw them near the Capitol and then they've been marching. They're called Patriots or something. I don't know what it's called. Yeah. On the left, we've got to go behind the tree. Marks & quase. Marks & quos. Marks & qos. Check over there. No, no, no. No, no aim. No aims. I Aim! Aims. I know you! I know you! Just do the job. Um, well, you can watch more than two episodes to be able to... It's got, it's gone downhill. The show is complete. It's not even true. I've been watching it. You saw it. You've been eating bread. These guys are... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. They're eating the first round. Are those slippers or just socks? They're socks! I took my shoes off. I didn't know we were going to run into this. Oh, true. I was trying to look at the US Capitol. Yeah, you've had to walk a long way. You've been waiting for this, Professor, so thank you. This is so cool. You've been waiting, so this is your prayer answered, so be grateful. This is true. Just ask the guy in the cowboy hat who they are and what they want. Yeah, well, they got a little mad when I was talking to them. They don't want women to vote for them. Why? You're America first? Put your hat on, no, put your hat on the right way. Yeah, but they are... Put your hat on the other way. They're really not the same as America first. Well, we don't know what they are. Well, they love America, but then they weren't allowed to tell me that. I'd rather have these people in power than stupid Biden. I'm sick of that guy. Yeah, me too. I'd rather have these guys in power than Doug Emhoff. I'd rather have these guys tell me what to do. They're hot. I'd much rather have... These guys are good looking and hot. I'd rather say yes, sir, to these guys than anybody. Let's go, Brandon. No, Brandon. These guys are good looking and they care about the daughters of the American Revolution. I think she's not wrong. It's true. I think they care. You're not wrong. I mean, look how peaceful they are and they got attacked so viciously, unprovoked. Who attacked them? They don't appear to have done anything wrong. No one attacked them. Antifa just goes... Off you go! Off you go! Off you go! Off you go! Off you go! Off you go! Off you go! Off you go! Off you go! Hi! I love this. It's so fun. Let's keep going. Bodyguards are supposed to be helping me. Yes, we're ready. We're going to do it more. No, they're fine. You guys are not doing good bodyguards. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. It happens all the time. Let us help you. You're supposed to be a black person. Don't scare me. You're a new live channel. You've got to go. I'll try to, but every time I do it, it's so bad quality. Like, my internet's not doing it for me. Oh my gosh. You see the peace? Don't tell us that's the peace. It's so rude. Yeah, they don't care about anything. These guys are hot, though. It's fine. They're really good. No, they're really sweet. I'm a daughter of American mothers, and they better help. We live in common as anyone would argue. And the change comes when a bodyguard is supposed to be watching me. You're supposed to be watching me. Yeah, you do need to. Yeah, and he's a bodyguard. You're getting yourself in trouble.

Yes, that's what that is. Okay. I think you're asking, does he turn around on the way back? Well... Or do you want them literally doing something like... Well, the men behind you are gonna be watching your back, alright? But, you know, of course, you, I mean... You're gonna react adaptively, okay? Everyone's got each other's backs here, so you're gonna have to rely on the men behind you if you do turn your back. And the guys behind these men have to guard your back, right? So, I'm gonna call cycle back, and y'all rest behind that car, okay? Alright, section cycle back! I'm sure you got it. No, you gotta go behind. You gotta watch what you're doing there, Ryan.

I think if we could all like run back in formation that could be handy too, like section double back and if everyone just everybody walked backwards, did it in units? OK, let's just try and see what it looks like. It could be abused in certain scenarios. Actually move back forward and do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's move back forward."

OK, I'm going to try that. If you guys want to rest, almost like you're resting your shield on it, you can reach forward with the hand on the shoulder. That's a little more tactical.

So see how you're slipping down my back? I want you to roll this way. You can put weight on my neck. Feel that? Now let this arm go to my hand. Okay, you feel that? How does that feel? You can lean forward into the neck if you need to. Ready? Roll this way for me. I'm too big. It's not as hard as it looks. Okay, give it a try."

I was thinking of the way where you get but if he's out, if he's out, you can like drag him by the leg. Either way, you just grab his foot and drag that. You can do. If he crosses his arms, you go underneath and you drag it so he's not, so his head, he can still. That's a one man. Oh, you're talking about two. I got you. Yeah, two on one. That actually is another carry, something you can do if you need to get someone out or put them down. It's really easy. I'll find it. You got him? You can drag him by. Yeah, so that way you have support. If his arms, if he's capable. If he's conscious. I doubt we're going to run into somebody totally clocking out hold."
50,2021-10-16_14.08.05.mov, I know. Get here. Like so. That might just be preference. You good? Yeah. That might be preference. I like the side to side too.
51,2021-10-16_14.08.48.mov," Drop your butt a little bit. Yeah, so check this out. Slow down. Stop here. Go back down. So when you get down to this guy, and granted if you're going high speed, you're going to grab what you can get, but what I would like to do, this can throw my back out. Bad juju, you go down to help your buddy tweak your back, and now you're down too. Even if we're in a high speed scenario and you're getting stuff thrown at you, I highly encourage, you can even drop a knee if you need to. Roll this guy up, brace your knee, get up under, and get what's called a gable grip. You can do S grips, don't interlace your fingers. Gable grip. I get under here, I tighten it, I get my hips up in here. Yeah, it looks funny and people aren't used to it unless you've been doing grappling. Get up in there so that I got everything I need to pull up with my legs. If I go down and try to do this wobbly back thing, you might screw your back up. All right, well, let's get more groups going at once then. Oh yeah, good idea. Try that again. Good, good, good. You're going to get a good handful of this drill. I know, I'm going to get a knock there. You're going to have to tilt me forward first. Okay, so the guy in front, I can already, I'll show you again. Good, we're going to break this down step by step so you guys get what's needed. And again, you can do it this way, you can do it side to side. One reason I encourage dropping the knee is because I'm kind of tall. If I try to get all this done down here, I'm way past my spinal point. I'm not a good squat. I can get down here and I want to wedge this right here. I get up under here. When I get in, it's crucial that you pull your hips in, straighten your back and look up. Okay? That's the concept I want to see, is the hips engage. It really does help to have lifted or having grappled. That's why we're here on the trail. So back down and grapple. Go slow. Think a little bit about what you're doing. All right, thank you. Let me review in here. All right, so you're right here. You're right here. You're right here. You're right here."

84,2021-10-16_16.49.00.mov," the wood, whatever. Keeping that in mind, if at any point during any training you feel like something is hurting too much, especially when we are striking, grappling is what I am focusing on right now, if you feel pressure, anything you are unsure about, you can tap out. All that means, and I will use an example, you are going with somebody, if you feel like hey this is too much, I am going to go ahead and tap out, and either step out or cycle them for the next round, you tap their body. If you can only reach yours, sure, or you can verbally say tap, you can stomp the ground, I am not going turbo, I am going to match you guys' speed, if you end up going turbo that is fine, but just keep in mind there is some tap in here, ok, and anybody who is worried about it, I got Sam's splints, don't make them get hurt. So, we are starting standing, this can go to ground, because we are talking about submissions and takedowns, but when we put somebody on the ground, again keep in mind, depending on who you are going with, you don't have to go full throttle, you can pace yourself, most of you are going to gas out in 30 seconds, people who have been going a little bit longer know how to pace themselves, so it is actually a really good ring size, we are going to try to stay away from trees and fences, if we get close to that, we stop for a second and reset over here. You want to get a ring of guys maybe, or? If you want to you can, people who are watching, you can be visually looking at where these guys are stepping, because if he is in the middle of the headlock, he might not see that his leg is swinging over towards this thing, just keep in safety in mind, it is not that hard. So the objective when we do grappling, specifically obviously no striking, I am not going to poke any eyes, I am not going to grab any fingers or toes, we are all wearing shoes though, I am not going to grab the groin, we are looking for pushing, pulling, if you want to try to pull a throw, go ahead and try it. Submissions, usually you are going to be either choking the person or you might go for a joint lock, whatever it is, don't rip these out lightning fast so that you are just breaking people, we are getting some conditioning in. If you are more experienced and you have gotten used to the partner you are going with, yeah we can, but just understand, I am not looking for the most buff of us to be like, and just snap his arm, not a lot of that, you can move fast if you want to. If you don't know any submissions, you don't know a whole lot of moves, it is not a big deal, just get in here, get some endurance work, get some conditioning going, if you have questions, ask them, sparring is going to be happening too. Now with grappling, usually what you do when you start, you come forward and you slap hands and you slap knuckles and now we begin, your objective can be to tap your opponent out, it can be to put him on the ground and hold him still, like wrestling, perfectly viable target, experiment and have fun, we will get started and do one now, so we go here, begin, now we are going. If you are looking to gain control, either knock me down, or hit me, whatever you have in mind. I have been there so many times. Obviously we are not combining striking yet, but that is what MMA is when you combine them. I can just sit here if I want, let him work his escapes, let him get his conditioning. I may decide to go on the offense, take an arm, and as soon as he feels like there is too much pressure, he might tap on my body. It is as simple as that, help your buddy up, and we keep rounds of that going, we can fit two groups in here, whoever wants to go, hop on in. Me and Chris have gone a lot harder for a lot longer. Chris is getting more experience, he has been going for a while, the better you get, you will see more of the high speed wrestling moves. Newer people, typically not as frantic. Whoever wants to go, step in here with me, or with Chris. This is going to be a king of the hill type thing, so don't let either one of us get any rest. Yeah sure, I will go. I will tell you, it might be why I sat on this one for a little bit. Good, good, good, go on the arm. Good. Oh, that is not working for me. Where is that? Hit. That is sick. Good strength, good consistent force. You wrestled before or just combatted? I grappled in the ring. Next, come on. While you are in the ring, if you bump into somebody, it is not a big deal. They are having a match, we are having a match. If we get, if we step on something, we can simply relocate, don't worry about it. Go on, take your time. When you take them down, you don't have to follow them down. Good, good. I am in first. It is awesome to have a three. Everybody, find a handsome freebie. Who has a win? Jack, Brian?"
85,2021-10-16_16.55.43.mov," Get multiple rounds, come on guys, this is conditioning. Josh, you have a way ahead of you. You want to start ahead? No, I'm good. Start on the ground. Go.

The state that governs us is wholly resistant to the change that is required to save the nation as it convulses and devours itself with unprecedented corruption. This nation once sought freedom from a tyrannical global power, and those who fought for liberty dedicated their efforts to the people they served rather than the government that denied them a future. Our people have conquered injustice before, both within our lands and within ourselves. Tyranny wields a new implements today, yet it bears the same ugly face. Americans are on the threshold of becoming a conquered people. No foreign state waved its banner on the halls of gardeners, yet it was our flag which grew foreign as the years passed. A new tyranny must be met with new resistance. America needs a generation of brave men to fearlessly rise to face all threats to their collective interests, a generation steeled in their effort to realize the grand vision of a new nation. This gathering of the faithful, the true inheritors of America, will urge our people onward. To form a new and just state, we must first instill a reformed national spirit within our people, a people free from the vices of the modern world, and a people with a fervor to see themselves free. The cohesion and unity of our people will be the most powerful weapon to be used in our tireless struggle for the nation and its timeless cause. Every soul who embodies the struggle will be an indispensable component of our unified effort for national sovereignty and collective liberty. Life, liberty, victory! Life, liberty, victory!"

266,20211016_143212.mp4," Alright, this is facing west on Memorial Avenue near Arlington. There's an exit onto the highway there, so the trucks can come past the Potomac roundabout. And you can see in the distance, stage on the street right here, and then let off onto the exit. And we will march forth."
267,20211016_143737.mp4, Standing on the Potomac roundabout that is looking for the Memorial Avenue towards Arlington and then this is looking over the Potomac. We'll figure out on the other side of the Potomac when we get to Lincoln whether we should be on the left side of the bridge or the right side respective to where we are right now.
268,20211016_145416.mp4," I'm gay now, I don't like it. I'm just gay as hell, right?"
269,20211016_145444.mp4, Thanks for watching!
270,20211016_145818.mp4, We're now by the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln. There's all the extranationals twerking. It's Grant and we're gonna be going that way on the right side relative to the ground.
271,20211016_150907.mp4, So this is the part that we actually did not do. Alright. So this is actually like a pool here. So we can't walk down that. We gotta go down maybe like this. This is gonna be hard with flags. That's not the way. So I think that probably it's like this way.
272,20211016_151003.mp4," So we go down that path last time We'll go down this little tiny one here But I think the end goal here we want to assemble Down inside the world war two in front of the fountain The 3 let's say Oh If you do the synchronous on that side too and then rejoin in the center, you just Can't catch up, you want to keep going"
273,20211016_151202.mp4," Lincoln in the back, World War II Memorial, and then that's going up to the Washington. I think probably we'd end up going up the center."
274,20211016_151318.mp4, Walk straight up the center to the DC the Washington Monument is looks like it's good
275,20211016_151621.mp4," Washington Monument, they have the path around and we all know how this is going to go."
276,20211016_152736.mp4," Alright, so we have the Washington Monument there. Now we have the National Mall. Two big old roads. Doesn't really matter left or right, we can take either or. Probably not the best idea to go on the grass just because you don't need to."
277,20211016_154052.mp4, We just went up the whole monument and now I forget what street we're on but we'll have to screen this one on our way to Destiny.
278,20211016_161138.mp4," Alright, so we're on the Supreme Court side of the building. We have a clear road up. There are these fences which will not be open in the beginning. They will close them likely. The idea is that we would start the march here. It would be way easier to get three trucks emptied out on this street and get them all formed up down there and get it going."
279,20211017_034424.mp4," We're pulling it up there. It's our banner. Hell yeah. To victory brothers! I don't know if you can see them, but they're up there on the billboard. We're making it. I'm doing it. See you later. Is the banner up there? Come again? Up there. Banner is up. Not yet. Clark, have you been recording all of this? Roger. You've been doing horizontal, not a vertical. When you take your video, it's worthless. Okay, I'm changing it to horizontal now. Okay. I did it horizontal-like for half of the other videos, but... I'll do horizontal no matter what the person says. Okay. I'm sorry, what was that? I'm sorry. What? What was that? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay, hold on. What is it? You're a little fuzzy there. What was that? What point are you guys at? They're climbing up the side ladder. Are they walking around down there? I see them on the east side of the road. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. What? I'm coming. I'm coming. Okay, hold on. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming up. I'm coming. They're coming. They're pulling the banner up to the top, the very top of the billboard. Okay. I'm coming. What? I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. What's the status up there? They're still pulling the banner up. I think they're struggling. I'm trying to get it up. The boat on the southeast is the end. Yeah, I see it. Go for it. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. You got the banner? Yeah, I do. You got the banner height? Yeah, I'm not allowed. They said on the side of it, they're climbing up. I'm not sure what they're doing. I'll tell you when we get it up. Over. Back up a bit. What was that? It looks like they're pulling it up from the side. Yeah, I'm just going to take this. Roger. There it is. It is kind of dark, so I don't know if y'all can see it, but that's our banner. Is it? There it is. There it is. There it is. We got the banner up on the top of that boat. Assessing the situation. Roger. There are bungee straps holding all these down. Here, here, go down there. Go down there. Just a normal looking civilian crew. Just a normal looking civilian car. As I was saying, there are bungee straps across holding these billboards up, so we'll have to find a way around this. No, bungee straps, not bungee straps. Holding the, uh, holding the, uh, um, not the billboards, but the material itself, you know, like the FBI thing, holding those down. They go across one side to another, just like on the video we watched. There's no way we're just trying to drop this thing over the gate. There's about ten bungee straps that hold one side of the billboard to the other, meaning we can't flip it over, so we'll have to find a way around this to figure it out. Just letting y'all know we're getting ready to flip it. Roger. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Figure anything out yet? Did you figure anything out yet? Okay. Okay. Clark. Clark, you hear me? Yes, sir. Clark, uh-oh. Repeat, repeat. We're gonna drop the whole thing. Tell you to revoke the bungee cord. Roger. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're gonna get the best bungee cord. Roger, understood. Repeat, repeat. Okay, we're gonna get the best bungee cord with this headlock. We want good footage of everything. Best bungee cord we have to use. Right leg, use right leg. I don't care if it's flying. Just let me know when it gets clear. The billboard is in full view. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Status? Repeat. I'm asking them how close they are. They're all tower, try them more. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right.

Great. Some cars have pulled in down by the other billboards down from us. I don't know if it's top or what. I am in a concealed position. Yeah, that is a cop. That is a cop and he's turned around. Seem to be in much of a hurry. I don't know what he's doing. You just don't think he could have seen us up here? Oh, he's shining his light. Hey, you need to take cover, Sir. Carter, if you're visible, he's sitting down there. At the next sign. Just chilling. The car just turned off. Oh, another car turned off there. Unless that is him. Alright. There's a cop. He's pulling back in again. He's patrolling the businesses, flipping around. I see him. I see your right side cover. I am concealed. Someone has been following us all around. No one's left the bus. What's the status of our surveillance team? The fire department is just trying to get a spotlight. They're just looking at the scene. Don't really know what they're doing. Okay, well, we'll keep you posted. We'll keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior. Roger. Okay. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beetle-Zhup. Ha! Switching engines. It'll suffer the con...

I'll like stand for the competition and protect us on the right. Thank you so much for coming here. I love that. Yes, we need a system where we can try to assemble freedom of religion. Freedom of the press doesn't exist. We live in communism with the press. Look at this. They're telling us where we can stand. We're supposed to be allowed to talk to people. We have the right to assemble. The police are not helping us right now. They're hindering us. We're supposed to have freedom of the press. We're supposed to be allowed to talk to anybody we want. In a public area. This is a public area. Okay. Okay. Got it. Okay. Okay. Good. Thank God that guy's leaving. We do not need police here right now. We need the right to talk and ask them what they want to stand up for. Corrine is on the front lines. Yes, I am. And I stand up for the US Constitution and the First Amendment. And that woman on the left, she almost ran me over today. And violated my First Amendment freedoms. And they're not letting us interview anyone. They're not letting us talk to anybody. That's normal in D.C. But what's not normal is they're allowed to let us go over there and talk and interview these people. And they're not. We have a good guy right there. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. We have a good guy right there. He's watching us. He's nice. I would love to go interview these people. These young men. The police are not letting us. The police are standing in the way of the First Amendment. We're not allowed to interview or talk to them. And that's unacceptable in the United States of America. So right now, the American media is being controlled too much. And that's communism. When the government controls the media, that's communism. And that's unacceptable. I would walk over there and talk to all these men. Everyone should know how to text me. 917-287-1314. 917-287-1314. I would love to know the truth about all of this. But the police are not allowing me to walk over there and interview anyone. Who, what, where, when, why, how. We have to get back to real journalism. Oh, there are fireworks over there. There are fireworks right over there. See across the bridge, there are fireworks. What is that for, do you know? We know nothing. Why are there fireworks across the bridge? There are fireworks across the bridge. Do you know why? Bag of Shaw. Why are there fireworks? No one answers any questions. They're right there. There's fireworks. Why? No, that's not in Virginia. Oh, it's the boat parade. It's the DC boat parade. I know more than everybody. It's the DC wharf boat parade. Okay, yeah, it's the DC wharf boat parade. Yeah, we missed the DC wharf boat parade. That's what it is. We missed the DC wharf boat parade, you guys. That's where we should go now. Okay, I know more than any of these people. This is ridiculous. No, I like these young men over here. They're hot. No, they're all married. They won't talk to me. The police. He'll talk to me. That's the DC boat parade. We missed it. My body's kind of hurting. See that they're making it so really harsh for their cow. Are they going to get a ride out of here? Fireworks at the DC boat parade. Do we even know the name of these people? I'm freezing. Okay, how do we get it? I'm so cold. Sorry, what do I do? Okay, there, sorry. I'm so cold. Thank God you noticed that. I'm freezing. I'm a shitty camera person, but who cares? The DC boat parade's going on right now. It's not about U-Hauls. It's about the DC wharf boat parade. It's not about U-Hauls. It's about standing up for the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Third Amendment. Yeah, Jeff Mack better say thank you. Yeah, Jeff Mack owes me a dinner. I'm not allowed to walk up and interview them because the police are stopping me. And that's un-American. That's a violation of the First Amendment. I would love to interview these super hot young men over here. But I can't because the police are stopping me. As per usual, the police are the problem. Yeah, they screamed at you when you tried. I know, and they made me fall. The police made me fall. Yeah, that's police brutality. Yeah, the black policewoman made me fall. Yeah. Yeah. When will the violence stop? The police do not help. Remember when I fell? They didn't say, are you okay? The police don't give a shit. Oh, they don't care if you're okay. They don't care. Yeah, they didn't care at all. They don't care. And they made me fall. They kept on pushing me. Because I've been through a lot with them. He's a high-ranking officer. He knows the ropes. I've been through a lot with him. He's actually really kind. Yeah. I've been through a lot, but I fell because that black policewoman was pushing me to the side too much. So it was a hate crime, actually. Oh, really? Wow, I have the best lawyers in D.C. now. I could sue anybody I want. I've got the best lawyers, the best law firm. Yeah, they need to be sued for their many crimes. They pushed me on the side and I fell. This evening, we've experienced police brutality against black people. These guys were so kind. Police brutality against First Amendment-protected media. Yeah, First Amendment auditors. There's police brutality by the Washington, D.C. police against First Amendment auditors. They pushed me on the side and I fell. And they're not letting us interview these young men. These super hot guys in white masks. Yeah, they want to know what it's about. These guys are super hot. Do you have their card? You guys can text me at 917-287-1314. And y'all single? You guys are hot. I'm flirting on the front line. I'm flirting. I need to be with a real militia man now. 917-287-1314. Y'all are so hot. Especially the one in the cowboy hat, but they're probably all married, so I'll get in trouble. I don't know married men. Oh my gosh, look at the fireworks. We're missing the fireworks at the D.C. Harbor. I'm freezing. Now you guys know what it's like to be on the front line in Washington, D.C. Fireworks at D.C. Harbor. Your fingernails hurt? Hello. Hello. Hello. My time is running out. How many more minutes do I have? We have at least four different police forces here. Yes, that's very normal. Park Police, D.C. Police, Private Police. It's a standoff. It's only a standoff because the police won't let us interview anyone. Oh, that's so kind of them. They love you, Professor. Yeah, do they want to know about what the group stands for? Yes, do you know what it stands for? I have some material from the Patriot Front, and here's what they say about themselves. Okay, what do they say? They say... Yes, sir. Can I see it? What? Oh, yeah, this... No, we're reading it. Oh, okay, sorry, sorry. I thought you were going to say, sorry. Yeah, so, they say... Yes. Yes, the democrats and republicans are both corrupt. Yes. Yes, okay, go on. So they want to have a new political party, perhaps? And they want to mobilize outside of the two-party structure. They want the constitution to reign supreme. First amendment, freedom of speech, right to assemble. And they recognize that... Freedom of religion. Oh, are you on YouTube? I might not be able to... I don't want the white... I might not be able to stay... These are not white... Okay, what? What did they say? Well, they say they recognize that the elections are fake. Oh my God. They do, they say the elections are fake. Oh my God, Anders, professor. I'm just reading from the card, it's not my fault. Why are you trying to get me in trouble? I get Karen so many strikes. You guys, okay, you... I get her all the strikes. That's his opinion, that has nothing to do with me. They like the constitution, what are you talking about? These are constitutional rights. So is the chat saying they're misrepresenting themselves? No. What does the chat say? They're saying that... There's five things I can't talk about and you just said one of them. I know, I've saw... Is it worth it that I could band every single day for First Amendment freedom and that's why these super hot young men are standing across the highway? The police are the ones causing the problem, they should just let them stand there and let us interview them so we can understand what they want. Oh. Well, what else did they say? What do they want? Do they want the constitution to re-increase? I don't want to get you in trouble. They have a lot about... They do? What else? How I can't tell... I can't read that out loud. Okay, don't say that. You see that? I can't read that. Is that an octopus? What is that? The octopus has a red octopus representing Republicans and it's eating a blue, so it's like they're both evil together. Alright, so it's two parties, one tyranny. Are you sure you got this from them? Yeah, that's from Patriots. Okay, look at all these fireworks over here. Anything else that you can read me? I don't know if there's anything else I can read you. So basically what they stand up for all gets censored and banned if I cover. Yeah, that's all I can read at this time. There's no fascism going on here. There's only violations of the First Amendment. But did they explicitly say that they're white nationalists? No, stop saying that word. It's just a bunch of stuff about... Oh my God, you guys. Okay, don't say that word. No, it's just stuff related to... No, they're not. They're just talking about elections and we don't know the truth about anything. And apparently I'm not allowed to talk about elections. You can't. You know that. Okay, someone please record the stream so that I can put it on the other channels because you know what happens when we start talking, when we start speaking truth to power. Moderator, palers, can you please make sure that this is recorded before I get banned again and again and again? Censoring American mothers is what these super hot young men across the highway are standing up for. They're sick of mothers getting censored. They're sick of the First Amendment being violated. They're sick of the Second Amendment being violated. Oh, thank you. Oh my gosh, I can't even see anything because I'm so cold. Yeah, these men across the highway are not fascists. These men want freedom. The police are being fascist, don't you get it? The police are not letting us interview them. Owl, pale horse, any moderators out there, please make sure that you have a copy of this live stream because I want to put on all of my channels. Y'all better archive this because all my footage gets disappeared by a corporate oligarchy run by Google that is corrupt, and that's what these young men in white masks want to stop. They want to stop censorship. They want to stop American mothers from being violated. They want to stand up for the US Constitution and say we are only going to allow freedom, freedom of expression. You guys know what I'm talking about. Yeah. Owl, can you please record this? Pale horse, please record this. Very important that you guys record all of this so I can put it on all my channels. I'll be very disappointed if y'all are not recording this. Please record it right now and archive it. Corinne forever had to grow up. Corinne now. Corinne forever had to grow up, and Corinne now got censored, and this is Corinne today. This is actually Corinne IRL. I'm the founderess of IRL today, yes. And I respect these young men. They're hot. I mean, look at that gun. This is so stupid. This is a waste of taxpayer money. Is that military or police with that gun? Yeah, this really isn't. They're the ones, the police, the DC police are stopping the traffic. The DC police are keeping us from going to DC wharf to go see the fireworks. I have two children complaining right now. I'm trying to do this seriously. Um, can you guys, like, act like these guys? Until the battery dies? Then I understand. Let's do my own stream. Yeah, you don't need me. Do your own, please. I'll do my own stream. Please, please do your own. I taught you. I mentored you. I'm the most censored woman in America. Corinne. This woman is a First Amendment violator. I'm censored every single day in a new and different way. And the police won't let us talk to the protesters, and that's un-American, that's a First Amendment violation. When the police won't let us interview the protesters, that's a First Amendment violation. That is against First Amendment. Look at these peaceful protesters. You can't even go talk to them. Let me ask, let me ask, this guy. Excuse me, guys. Is anybody parked over here? No. Is the last vehicle here? Hey, backshaw. Hello. Will you let us interview those people over there? Come on, please. I'm freezing. Anybody have a personal vehicle in the circle? Come on, you're not going to interview them? Why? What are the laws on this? Because I have lawyers. You do? Yeah. Like the biggest lawyers in DC now. Who are the lawyers? DC lawyers. Like First Amendment has to be respected. Can we walk over here, the real media? Will you let us walk over there and talk to them? No, I respect you so much. Can we talk to the protesters? Why? They're not dangerous. Why? They're not dangerous. Do you know what group this is? I have no clue who this is. So, we're just not, we're just teaching this. This is media, he's media, he's media. This is all, everybody's credentialed. That's the other piece as far as I'm sure everybody is familiar. Yeah, I'm Corrine. Who is my name? Do you know me? Corrine. Yes, oh, you're such a liar. You're lying. And these are my bodyguards. Bodyguards, too? I have to have bodyguards. Yeah, why do police officers, a female black police officer push me and I fell today? Yeah. So, anyway. Down over there, it's all recorded. But hey, look, I have a question. So, why can't we interview them? Because right now we're keeping everyone separated. Why? They want to talk to us. Do they? Yes. What do they want to say? I don't know, you won't even talk to us. Well, I don't know they want to talk. They want to talk to us and you won't let us. Want me to go ask them? They want to talk to us and you won't let us. You're interfering with like the media's ability to interview them. You live in a totalitarian police state. What am I supposed to do? You won't let me interview them. Are you sure you're the highest level police officer here? Where's the FBI when we need them? Well, why can't we interview them and ask them what they're doing? Like, I won't do it, we could have Ford and him do it. You could have them do it. I don't care if I do it. I just want to know what they're doing and what they want. I don't care if I do it. I just want to know what they're doing and what they want. I just want to know what they're doing and what they want. Don't let me go over there. Look, I have blonde hair. They don't care. Will you let me cross the police line and interview them? Why? I'll take the risk. I'll risk. I'm a daughter of the American Revolution. I'll take the risk. No? I don't know. Isn't the media supposed to be free and allowed to go over there and talk to people and interview them? It's a violation of the First Amendment if you don't let the media interview people. Oh my gosh. I mean, you think it's dangerous for me to do that? What if I go on the other side and I say, hey, can I interview you guys? Are you serious? I can't walk forward? What about these guys? The Daily Beast and Ford Fisher and Corinne. You know me. Oh, it's freezing though. I mean, I'm probably going to have to go to the Supreme Court at this point because how are we supposed to interview people in the middle of this? You can't. I can't? Why? They want to talk. Do they? Yes. Do they? Yes, but let me walk over there. They're really nice. If I walk over there, can I take my own risk? No? Okay, that just seems like a violation of the First Amendment for you to impress. But you know I respect you 100% because I've been through a lot with you. You're good at this. What? You're good at this. No, you and I have been through a lot. Yes. And last year this time I'm going to get to the death. I just, I feel like we should have a talk with them. Although they probably, whatever they're going to say, I'll probably get banned everywhere and I can't sell the footage because I'll probably be so censored. Because this is the most censored stuff. It's something about the elections. I can't even say it. We're getting so censored. You said I'm the best? Really? Thank you. Thank you. I try to be really neutral. Aw, you have to go peace. I bless you, peace death. Peace death. Thank you, I really try to be neutral. I mean this is like... I can't sell this footage. I'll get censored on everything. I have to have bodyguards. And I'm freezing. I'm freezing. Can't cross the state line. Alright, well I'll just stand here until my batteries die, right? Ugh. Are you getting like orders from higher up? Because you were a very kind person and you would let us talk to them. I'm always a kind person. Yeah, so I mean if it was up to you, you'd let us talk to them. It's not your decision, right? So who's giving the decisions that we can't talk to these people? No, it's my decision. Really? But they're really nice. They were total gentlemen. For reason. Okay, he's the highest level police officer and he said we can't interview them. The highest one? Oh yeah, backshot, yeah. He said we can't interview them, which is really weird. He could be sued for denying media access. He can, but I like him. I like backshot, he's sweet. But they're not supposed to deny us access. What's his name? Backshot. Backshot. Backshot. Yes. He's always been very protective and kind to me. I mean, he cannot credibly say that there's any imminent danger. There's no imminent danger that he's not getting us interviewed on. But he's making the executive decision. Oh, there's the U-Haul. Let's go stay in the grass and I'll stay on the sidewalk. Is backshot telling you that? I'm only going to do what officer backshot tells us to do. Oh, it's so cold. That's why they got the gentle ride. 10-1-4. I'm a little bit... Oh, they're shining a police light. That's so rude. That's so unfair. I'd show you the sunlight. What's that? I don't know. I don't know. I'm going to get in there. I'm going to get in there. The police are shining flashlights in our face. That's just so rude. I'm going to get in there. They're saying Antifa police. That's funny. Yes, there are Antifa police. You shine lights in your face and block your First Amendment freedom of the press. But we have huge selfie sticks. I have a huge selfie stick, yes. You have a huge selfie stick. Do you have a selfie stick? Yes, I do. I don't have one. I just want to bring it back and put it in my pocket. I mean that guy's a real media. They should not harass him. No. Okay, thank you. I don't know. I don't think I would ever do that. 8.12pm EST 9pm EST The DC police are blocking the freeway. The DC police are not allowing media to interview the men in white masks who marched across Washington DC tonight. That's a violation of the First Amendment. But I'm freezing right now. And I like the officer in charge of this, so I'll be really respectful. Look at that. 9pm EST This is a First Amendment audit of how the DC police handle our ability to interview people properly and they're interfering with it. 9pm EST As media we're supposed to be able to interview protesters and they're not allowing us to. And I'm willing to take any risk. These protesters are peaceful and they're organized and they're all wearing white masks and I want to interview them and the police are not allowing me to. And that's a violation of the First Amendment. I like the guy in the cowboy hat. These guys are all married and if they're not married I'm available. I'm flirting. Al, don't get mad, I'm flirting now. The guys in the white masks are hot. You know I'm a big flirt. If I don't flirt I'll just go home and cry my eyes out because our country is so divided and these men in white masks are standing up for the Constitution. And the DC police are blocking us from being able to interview them. 9pm EST So any of y'all in the white masks if you want to talk to me you can text me 917-287-1314. I would love to interview any of you guys anonymously anytime. Please archive this footage. Please make sure it's recorded properly. Please put it on all my channels. Great God Pillars. Please Al will record this footage and put it on all my channels please. Because the DC police are not allowing us to interview the protesters wearing white masks. And that's a violation of the First Amendment. I need you to archive this footage. Because the DC police are not allowing us to interview the protesters wearing white masks. And that's a violation of the First Amendment. Freedom of the Press. It's warm right here. Wait, why is it warm? Oh my god, it's warm. You're so smart. Oh my god, it's warm. Wow, it's great. Wait, it's really nice right here. You should come right here. It's really warm. Oh my gosh, it's so nice. I would really like to interview any of the super hot young men wearing white masks. I'd love to interview every single protester everywhere across America. But the police are not allowing us to interview anyone. I mean, I'd probably get banned for whatever they said, but I would really like to interview any of these super hot young men in the white masks. 917-287-1314. It's Corinne. C-O-R-I-N-N-E-I-R-L. Founder of IRL Today. You guys keep on trying to censor me, but I'll come back again and again and again. All power to the people. And one thing I want to say is that I think these people in the white masks would agree with the people who are protesting in front of the police station tonight. That the police have become a totalitarian police state and they're protecting property and they're not allowing us to communicate or have our First Amendment freedom of speech. So we should all agree that the Constitution in the United States of America has to be respected. And if it's not respected, then we'll all become political prisoners. Washington, D.C. is totally depressing without American patriots. Washington, D.C. is really depressing without true American patriots. So the police should allow me to interview these super hot men wearing white masks. And the police should allow me to interview all the protesters. And they should not be separating us anymore because the media has to be able to interview by the people, for the people, of the people, with the consent of the people. Constitution only. And we have our beloved friend Ford Fisher on the front line. And we have Professor 1776 today on Rumble. And I have every single channel everywhere. Join my Telegram IRL today. I've got so much footage. And I should have been allowed to be able to interview these super hot men in white masks who are standing on the Virginia border. Who just marched fully legally throughout Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Capitol. It's all about respecting the Constitution and respecting our beloved United States of America and our freedom. We cannot allow the American dream to be disrespected. We cannot allow the American dream to fade away. And that's what these young men in the white masks stand up for. Another selfie stick broken. Time to donate. NPR doesn't tell you the truth. PBS doesn't know anything. Time to donate to independent media. Ford Fisher needs major donations. Corrine. Cash app, dollar signs, C-O-R-R-I-N-N-E-N-O-W. Corrine, now we need major donations. And I'm really like this guy in the cowboy hat across the way over there. You know what excites me the most? It excites me the most when I see passionate protesters who respect women. Passionate protesters who respect the U.S. Constitution. I do not like it when the police doesn't let us interview the protesters. And that's what's happening right now. And that's the news. Basically, we are living in communism with the media. The media is so censored. And that's unacceptable. If we could all communicate, we would find so much in common. We'd find common ground. We're not allowed to communicate anymore with protesters. And in California, it's illegal to even cover protests that have to do with any type of... I can't even say it. I'm not going to tell you. Covering protests has become illegal, and that's not American. We're supposed to have a First Amendment, and California is violating it. And now the D.C. police are not allowing us to interview the protesters, and that's unacceptable. So the more freedom we give away, the more we won't have freedom. So you want to live with freedom? You want to live with the First Amendment? Freedom of speech, the right to assemble, freedom of religion, yes. The police are preventing me from flirting with the men in white masks. I really don't flirt. I'm told to flirt. The police are preventing me from interviewing the men in the white masks, and I'm freezing. 91 minutes and 34 seconds. I just gave you one of the greatest live streams in American history, in the Her Story of America, the Daughters of the American Revolution. I should be proud of everyone who stands up for the U.S. Constitution. Tell me when. Tell me when. You ready? I'm freezing. What do we do? I don't think there's going to be any further questions. I know. What do we do? I'm freezing. Freezing. Okay, so the bottom line is that the police are not allowing us to interview the protesters in the white masks. So any of the protesters in the white masks, if you want to call me on the unicorn phone, 917-287-1314. I have tons of channels and I will not censor you. What's that? A person trying to use the public space. That can't be allowed. What? That's against the law. That's a violation of the First Amendment again. That's a shame. So this is a First Amendment audit and the D.C. police are failing. Yeah, they failed. They totally failed. F. Okay, what's a brown shirt? Is there military out here too? Is there nationality? Brown shirt is a term for a fascist militia, I think. There's no fascist people out here. Just totalitarian police who protect property and real estate. I asked the police to let me through this line to interview the men in the white masks. And they said no and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm willing to risk my life, my liberty, my pursuit of happiness for the First Amendment. Freedom of press only. Yeah, fascism is ruling and the police are allowing freedom of press to not be allowed to interview the super hot men in the white masks who are protesting peacefully. Hey, I'm almost ready. Are you? Tell me when you're ready. Okay, what's our exit strategy? Start taking logistics. What do we do? We go back where we came from. I know, but that's too easy. That's the exit strategy. We're going to have to call an Uber. I'm freezing. An Uber won't work here. We need an address, right? An Uber won't work here. We have to go to the Lincoln Monument. Lincoln Monument. We're not going to make it all the way back there. We will. We will? I have no shoes on. Yeah, I know. We will? I have no shoes on. Yeah, I know. It's freezing. This always happens to me. This happened to me last December when I was following the Proud Boys 3DC. And now the Proud Boys are infamous. And the guy that I was following 3DC in a wheelchair, Eddie Block. Eddie Block, you're a jerk. He said I was Antifa and he tried to get me beaten up by women wearing Trump clothing. And now he's on the HBO special. So trust me, my live streams highlight everyone who's of consequence. And that's why the officer backtaught. He understands what I've been through because I'm very neutral. And I respect the First Amendment and everyone's right to peacefully protest and it's unacceptable that they're not allowing us to interview the super hot men in white masks. Yeah, he said he just chatted. He's right. What? Corey, you're correct. Corey. Oh my God, Corey, I should have married you. What happened? What did he say? He said we're living under communism. Yeah, because media is not being allowed to interview the men in the white masks. Yeah, this is a joke. This is not what the First Amendment allows. Exactly. So I got the best legal team now. You probably should sue these people. I mean, it's time for all of us to sue in a class action lawsuit because we're not allowed to be media anymore. Yeah, the Constitution is a much higher authority than the D.C. police. Exactly. Time to respect the Constitution. What kind of police is that? I mean, the only reason why I'm being very calm is because if I interview them, I'll probably get banned anywhere, everywhere. Because what they're going to say is going to get me banned. But I'll do it in private. Text me on the unicorn phone. 917-287-1314. That's police. It says police. They're just telling us that they exist. They're just making us dance saying we exist. And they're telling us that they're here in case we need them. And the guy in the cobblehead who leads us is super hot. And they're 100% respectful to American women. Which is really important right now because nobody's been really respectful to American women lately. Are you ready? 8.29pm. What does that mean? The time has come. We've been here for two and a half hours. We have? No, it only says 97 minutes. Have you been live streaming continuously? I'm not anti-anything weirdos in the chat. I'm not answering these dumb questions. I'm pro the First Amendment. We have to leave. Okay, three more minutes. No. No, I'm going to go to 100 minutes. Okay, okay. Countdown. Two minutes. I'm not anti-anything. I'm saying I'm anti-something. I'm pro the First Amendment and I'm not reading chat because unless you're a major donator, I'm going to ignore you. Unless you donate serious cash to all my channels, I'm going to ignore you because I get censored and I risk my life, my liberty, my personality. I risk my life for a little bit of happiness and I'm freezing every single day to show you what's happening in your city or county or state and on the federal level. And if you don't respect that, then I'm not going to answer any more questions. Okay, we can go. Let's go. It's so long we've been at. Like 90 seconds left. Ooh, top of a breezing. Anyway, the guys in the white masks are super hot and they're super peaceful and they're just saying, hey, we're here for you when it's time to defend the U.S. Constitution. They're just saying, hey, we're here for you. And I'm saying I'm ready. I'm ready. Time to defend the U.S. Constitution. They're being totally peaceful. 917-287-1314. The unicorn phone is on. Yes. We need all the peaceful protesters. Yes, we respect you so much. Thank you for being here. Thank you for letting us know that you're still around. Thank you for letting us know that you still care about us. Ooh, you prayed for us. We cut the chat down. I'm sick of phone police, actually. Yeah, I think we... Shout out to Ford Fisher News2Share. Okay, we're going to go. Ford, will you at least just text me what happened? Will you text me what happened? Because I'm freezing. Will you just text me if anything, any arrests or anything? Will you? At least give me that. God bless you. Peace. Thank you. Divine providence is what you say. I'm freezing. Bye. Hi. I have the best legal team. They're violating... They're like, hi, bye. It's so stupid. They're violating the First Amendment freedom of the press. Okay, now where are we going to get an Uber from? I'm freezing. We're freezing. I'm freezing. I make no money on that. There shall not be a bridge. Yeah, we're going to have to protest freedom of the press now. Look at this. All these D.C. police are violating our freedom of the press. Oh my God, can we get an Uber? Is that an Uber? No. Oh, it's freezing. And we need bathrooms everywhere. Jeez, for hygiene. We need bathrooms and freedom of the press. That's the reign supreme. And those super hot men in white masks. The super hot men in white masks are better than the D.C. police right now. Because at least they care about our Constitution. Oh! Woo, it's freezing. Can you believe that? They failed the First Amendment audit. I know, I can't believe it. I think my toes are going to be frozen. What is it that happens when your toes freeze? Is that gangrene? Oh my God, shut up, professor. That was an amazing experience with you. Yes, that was amazing. And I fell, and you saw everything happen. And you saw us getting violated by the police not allowing our First Amendment. Yeah, I wanted to interview those people, but the police were pretty much letting them do whatever they wanted to do. Yeah, like, the media is not a threat. You can't keep the media away from peaceful protesters, and they were being peaceful. They were so peaceful and nice. We have no idea who they are. They won't even tell us. We don't even know. Do you have the sticker? Do you have the sticker? No, they're so nice. From what we saw, they appeared to be peaceful. They're the patriotfront.us. I don't know what that means. Yeah, we never heard of them before tonight. They are not bad people. They're wonderful. patriotfront.us. Woo, it's freezing! Oh my God, what do we do now? How do we get an Uber out of here? Washington Monument or Lincoln Monument? Lincoln Monument. Okay, I'm going to freeze. Oh my God, the police are all saying goodbye to us. The police are violating our freedom of press, and that's unacceptable in the United States of America. I wanted to interview the men with the white masks on. Woo, it's freezing! You know there's tons of militias in every city, every county. Oh my God! What? Oh my God, stop. He's a performance artist. He's like Carl. He's joking. Shut up. He's lying. No fake news. Wait, how do we do this? We've got to walk across here. What do we do? Okay, you've got to get an Uber because none of us have Uber because all of our phone batteries are dead. Anders has to get it. Okay, where do we get it from though? What happens when we cross? Okay, do we end up at the Lincoln Monument? Where do we end up? We need to go to the U.S. Capitol. Oh my God, it's so cold. Okay, listen, Pale Horse, please, please keep this footage. Download it. Store it. Everybody archive it. Everyone can have this footage. Jeff Mack, you can have it. Everyone can have it. Everyone can have it. Fort Fisher was nice. I know. Oh my gosh. Wasn't it funny when I fell? No, it was funny. I know, I'm sorry. A black female police officer pushed me. I thought it was a male. No, a black female police officer pushed me. Vicious and unacceptable. Oh my gosh, and they won't let us interview anybody. God, I can't believe we didn't know that was happening. Why didn't anybody tell us? We were right across the street and you were getting so depressed. Why did Fort Fisher deprive you of that knowledge? No, he said he didn't know. He probably knew from my livestream. Oh. Nobody knew. Oh, he knew from yours. I don't know. Nobody knew. So we were literally the first on the ground. Yeah, why didn't we know it was going on? We were the only media actually doing the job. No, Richard knew it was going to happen, but then he got sidetracked by a girl. So... That's the Kennedy Center. Why didn't you tell us? Well, he told me, but he couldn't confirm it. He said there was a huge thing that was going to happen and then he couldn't confirm it. And then he just got sidetracked. Hmm, that's not a good sign. I just got a cold case notification, but for no reason. What do we do? What do we do? Wait, what happened? Bitcoin's at 48.9. That's low. Oh my gosh. Okay, so what should we get it? How do we get an Uber out of here? I'm freezing. You can't have an Uber out here. You can't come to just the middle of the bridge. Look what I risked for you guys. I'm wearing socks and leopard print pants. Where's Jocelyn Wyoming? Where are all my moderators? That's what I'm wearing. And Duke University socks. Yes, I want the Duke University. I broke a selfie stick, a tripod, and I broke another phone. Yes! No! If you guys want us to continue, you better understand the importance of independent media. Woo, it's freezing. Do you think it's the Lincoln Monument? Is that the right move? Oh my gosh, don't say that. Oh no. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Do you think it's the Lincoln Monument? Is that the right move? Oh my gosh, don't say that. Oh no. I'm going to do it. Like, imagine telling yourself that you protect and serve, and that's what you do. That is laughable. What do you mean? Say it more bluntly. These police officers enforcing a violation of the First Amendment, is this what they signed up to do? Are they just thugs in uniform? They just do what the state tells them? It's disgusting. They have no valid basis to deny media access. We couldn't even go up and try to interview them. Yeah, and one of them pushed me and I fell. Police brutality occurred. They should be seen. They should really be seen. I have the best legal team in D.C. now. Because independent media, media is not being respected. For a reason. For a reason. No, we don't want to defund the police. Defunding the police is stupid. No, but they should respect our rights. No, we don't want to defund them. I just want them to respect our First Amendment. They think it's such a joke, and it's not a joke. It's dead serious. And we would have had fun. We would have had fun talking to the guys in the white masks. It would have been really fun. They were really fun when they were marching. I can't believe we have to walk over this. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh, where are you going? For what reason? Well, there's police over there. I just want to make sure no one gets arrested over there. Oh well, it's too late, right? It's too late. It's too late, baby. Yeah, speak truth to power. Tell us about all the militias across America. In every single city. Every county in every state. Tell us about everything. Time to stand up for the U.S. Constitution and our freedom. Yes, what? The right to organize a militia is protected under the Second Amendment and under the First Amendment. It's freedom of assembly, and it's specifically mentioned in the Second Amendment. Every citizen has the right to join a militia. Yes! Peaceful. Peaceful. Oh my gosh, no, that would be a mess. No way. You need to be honest. You're going to make me throw up. Oh my God, no way, that would be a mess. I can barely handle anything I have now. I can barely handle what I do now. So, are your shoes in the car? Yes. States' rights are damn near abolished. We've got to bring the rights back to the states. Maybe it's time for Texas to secede from the Union. Woo-hoo! That's legal. In February, they can start the vote, and then by November, they can vote on it. It's all about the legality of the Constitution. Of Texas seceding from the Union, it's legal. Secession now. Here I come, Texas! I love New York, though. I love Washington, D.C. Yeah, the D.C. police failed all night long. The D.C. police were just pushing us around too much all day. Even before this, it's like every minute, the D.C. police were pushing us around. We live in a totalitarian police state where the police protect what? Property? What were they protecting over there? They weren't protecting us when I fell. Nobody helped us at all. So, yeah, the governor of Florida, DeSantis, started his own militia, which is very interesting. Texas already has their own militia for their governor. I think that all the militias and all of us would agree that we all have one thing in common. We all just want our freedom. Now, do you think that's a false flag to make us not notice what's going on over there with those police? It could be. I received some messages from others who were expressing that they thought maybe this was just a false flag. A false flag? To do what? Think about not being in D.C.? Yeah, one person told me the theory that it could be a false flag to distract from the Maxwell trial. I find that not plausible. Not in D.C.? What else did they distract us from? Look at that. Slow down, dude! That's rude! Don't you think that's rude? Yeah. So far, the D.C. police have put us in danger all day. We know what's happening over there. We have no reason to question it. Exactly. Chill out, D.C. police. Yeah, they're out of control. Yeah, they're out of control at this point. They need to chill out. We live in a police state that needs to... The police are your servants to the people, by the people, for the people, with the consent of the people. All the police need to know that you're servants of the people. You're supposed to keep the peace, not create stress. I didn't like that one kid that was talking to you guys in the back about nothing. He needs to leave. I have to keep my press credentials and I can't do it if that guy's talking about nothing. Yeah. Max thought he might have been offended. The thing is that we have to keep our media at a certain level, because otherwise, if we let those people around... Now what do we do? Oh my God, is there an address anywhere? It says, sacrifice, a gift from people of Italy to the people of the United States of America. I don't know what that means. Okay, what do we do? It'll be done by then. Okay, wait, can we walk over here? Wait, I have to do that too. Wait, where do we walk? Oh my God, how do we cross the street? What do we do? We should go on that side and then walk to the Lincoln Monument that way. We're going to cross here and go to the Lincoln Monument. Yeah, we're going to walk across here and then go to the Lincoln Monument right there. I'll do it first. I'm running. I'm running, running, running, running. Woo-hoo! I know! I have no spit in my mouth anymore. I really like those guys wearing white masks. You guys think it's over? It's not over. Okay, so I think that that was like a deterrent from something else that's going on. But what if we wake up tomorrow and there's a whole bunch of people at the US Capitol and it starts getting fun out here again? Maybe they're saying it's time for everybody to come back to DC and let's have some fun peacefully. United, not divided. We all agree that the Constitution has to reign supreme, correct? Woo-hoo! Okay, so we just crossed over there to Lincoln. So where did we park yesterday? The US Capitol. Pretty far. We should just get from the Lincoln Monument to the US Capitol because of the freezing. Okay, thank you. It's so cold. We can go to the bathroom. Oh yeah, we parked at the US Capitol. Yeah. Who's the backside? Oh man. We're going to find out. No, it's definitely free parking. It's definitely free parking. Yeah. I was wondering why there were so many police there. I was like, what's going on here? So the other thing was deterring from this thing. It's like there must be so many things going on and we just don't even know. Okay, so let's get to a good pickup place. It's like, where is it? That's the Lincoln Monument. Another selfie stick bites the dust. And I have to pee so bad. And his phone battery is going to be dead but I can charge it. Woo! I need tons of phone cords. We need tons of donations. Cash app, dollar sign, C-O-R-A-N-N-E-N-O-W. Oh my gosh, it's so cold. It's so cold. Okay, I think we have to go on this side to be taken seriously but I'm pretty sure. To be taken seriously. I should be stick skinny at this point. All I do is run around. I'm trying to figure out what is going on here. Who gives you more footage of Washington DC than me, Corinne? C-O-R-A-N-N-E. Join me on Instagram, Corinne IRL. I'm real and I do not edit. And I do not even have a selfie stick that works. My selfie stick is a little bit of a pain. And I do not even have a selfie stick that works. My selfie stick is broken. So who cares? My footage is historical. Wait, do you think we should sit here? Well, if we go further, there's no car that can come through these. Oh, there isn't? Okay. Okay. We're ending at the Lincoln Monument. And what I do is active IRL. And what I do is active IRL. And there's no female in America who does what I do. I can barely talk because I'm freezing so much. So keep on saying whatever you want to say. I'll just turn you off, I'll turn you on, and I'll turn you off and on all the time. I'll just turn you off, and then I'll turn you on, and then I'll turn you off, and then I'll turn you on. And it'll be really funny. Yes. Ooh, that was creepy. That comment was so creepy. I don't even know what to say except that I'm freezing cold right now. Ooh, it's cold. Should I do a Corrine twirl? Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Oh, that was a lot of walking. And I have no shoes on. I just have my socks on. That was a lot to recover from. That was a lot to see. It was very exciting. And those men in the white masks were very intriguing. So the whole experience I'm so grateful for. I'm so thankful. Thank you for allowing me to be neutral. I do not take a side. All I do is stand up for the First Amendment because I'm a First Amendment auditor. And that's what I do. I tell you the truth about... I tell you the truth about what's going on in your city, your county, your state, on the federal level. And my footage is everywhere. And please archive this. Please share it. I will not care at this point. I need you to share this footage and archive it. We need to know everything, everything, everything. May the goodness bless your life. God bless you. Peace. Divine providence is the right way to say it. If you don't know that, then you need to know it. Divine providence is the way you say this. Thank you."
380,3823773_hour_stream-Live_Armed_Protesters_Patriot_Front_Marching_Through_Washington_D.C_12-4-.mp4," You You You You You You You You You You You You I have no idea. I mean they've been pushing everyone else away. So my Guess would be that either they're part of the group where there are people No, I know but were those particular press guys I'm sorry Honestly, my guess is probably just like Actually one of them has a capital threat so I don't know I don't know They're either not letting him out or they're telling him that if he leaves he can't go back in I don't know You You So again We're just kind of standing here just to kind of reiterate the Situation here the This is the Virginia side of the bridge that connects The Lincoln Memorial to basically Arlington National Cemetery on this side The once they kind of arrived here and went like, you know, 500 feet off of the bridge They kind of stopped here and then police formed a line between them and then the press and kind of protesters basically everybody who's not part of Patriot Front and then there were two U-Haul trucks. They were there were brand new haul trucks like moving trucks that several of them got into And basically drove away and I think that took maybe like half or a little less than half of them As they just drove off and so what's standing here now is, you know 50 or so of these guys Many of them holding shields, you know toward the toward the front or the side facing, you know press and stuff But the police are basically standing here, you know in between anyway But then they've got a shield line and my assumption is that they're waiting for those same U-Hauls to come back after bringing those guys Somewhere else, but I don't actually know Yeah Again it appears that they use rental trucks, which is somewhat similar to They did a stunt sort of like this in February of 2020 where they marched a pretty similar route from pretty much here to the Capitol, but then they left near Union Station in DC and When they left there they had like rental trucks So it appears this time they're using like rental moving trucks Although I wasn't at this particular event My understanding is that they also use moving trucks in Philadelphia where they had a similar but smaller stunt Oh Also, I should note I in case any sort of backtalk was audible there were some people on my side There's some people on on this side of the line media basically Who are wondering why there were a couple of what appeared to be other media on that side of the line photographing the Patriot Front people up close. I didn't mean for this to be audible, but I speculated that you know They have some of their own camera people So it might have been people who were with them or who were explicitly sort of approved by them At least one of their national press credentials was visible and I actually received a text from someone else like So I don't think either of those two journalists I was looking at are like affiliated with the group But I'm not sure what caused them to be able to be on that side of the line Where's the other presses and so either they're embedded or they just managed to get really close Looks like the police are moving This is good stuff guys, we need more of this get these guys down there every day Subscribe to the channel share it Keep this shit going.

384,"390731Kim_Iversen_Joe_Rogan_Calls_BS_On_Patriot_Front_March,_Is_The_Group_Backed_By_Feds-720p.mp4"," What's on your radar, Kim? Well, Joe Rogan is questioning whether or not the white nationalist group Patriot Front is real or another FBI operation. Uniformed white nationalist group marches on Lincoln Memorial. CNN's all in. They're like, we're all in on this. Come on, show us. Look at these guys! Look at these guys! Where's the fat people? How come they're all wearing the same clothes? Do that again. What the f*** is this? Is that, have you ever seen anything that looks more like feds? Tell me that doesn't look like feds. Right? It's like the 101st Airborne. Bro, look at this! These guys are all runners! These guys look like they just got out of Buds. I mean, look. Get the f*** out of here. They could be real. Right, they could be real. They could be real. Listen, Matt Taibbi, I'm an unreliable source, and I'm a comedian. But looking at that, I'm calling bulls***. Give me that again. Give me that again. Uh, yeah, okay. Well, this gets back to the Oklahoma Ivermectin story where you, you know. Right, where they're all wearing winter coats. Yeah, like you, you know. Look at this! The f*** out of here. How do they all have, like, uniformed outfits on? They have the same color pants, for the most part. Very little variation. They have tan or brown pants, dark blue shirts with a f***ing stupid flag on it. This b***h got a drum! Back that up! Look at the f***ing drum! B***h, are you Paul Revere? What the f*** are you doing with that drum? He's walking around with a band drum. It's a white power drum line. This is so stupid, it hurts my feelings. Well, the march Rogan is referring to happened this past Saturday, December 4th, in Washington, D.C. There were about 100 to 200 demonstrators. They all wore matching jackets, khaki pants, carried flags or shields, and seemed fairly organized, marching to the beat of a snare drum. Because they were so seemingly organized, others besides Rogan wondered the same thing. Comedian and author Tim Young wondered, Was today's Patriot Front parade just the FBI spending their end-of-year use-it-or-lose-it budget? Host Mr. Reagan tweeted, So this made me curious. I'd never heard of this group, and I wanted to dig deeper. Who are they, and what are they about? Could it be that Joe Rogan's suspicions are right, and this is an FBI operation? Or is this group very real and a genuine growing threat? Or is this group real and not really a growing threat, but one that can easily be ignored instead? Well, it turns out the group began in 2017, after the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally that resulted in the murder of Heather Heyer. That rally was organized by a group called Vanguard America. But apparently, after the chaos and violence, there was some infighting between the main leader of the group and one of his underlings. Ultimately, the underling, Thomas Rousseau, who was 18 at the time, decided to leave Vanguard America because of the violence and start his own group that he called Patriot Front. So the group is decidedly nonviolent, but they do believe that the country should be run exclusively by people of European ancestry. They do think people from different places and backgrounds can live in America, and they state they believe they can even be good citizens, but they should not be considered Americans nor make decisions for the country. They spend a lot of time talking about the corruption of our government and how bought off they are by corporations. They are very anti-drug. None of their members can use substances. They say the Americas were conquered by the colonizers, not stolen, and seem to be very proud of this. They say they believe in revolution and resisting tyranny, but I haven't seen any photos of any of them with any firearms or weapons. In fact, the worst thing this group seems to do is hang posters advertising themselves and tagging buildings with their slogans. What stands out about this group and where one could come to the conclusion that this really is an FBI operation is how polished and organized they are. First of all, their website is extremely professional with well-done graphics, professional photos, and even a cinematic video trailer. It's almost too professional. Their social media posts are uniform and look like they're managed by a social media expert. Everything is color-coordinated and themed. Even their graffiti is done with stencils. Their manifesto sounds like it's read by a professional voice actor. Nothing is sloppy. Snooping around their social media posts, you'll see videos and photos of the members who are relatively young-looking, participating in boot camp-style athletic drills and doing boxing workouts. They go on hikes and excursions, and they always, always wear matching uniforms and white face coverings. They've held several marches around the country similar to the one held in D.C. In places such as Philadelphia, Salt Lake, Nashville, and San Antonio, and when looking to sign up for the group, the forum explicitly asks the members to never divulge any information that would identify themselves. They protect their identities from the organization and from each other. So I'm not going to lie. Between their website, social media posts, cinematic trailer, and manifesto, and their organized marches, it's really hard to believe that some 18-year-old kid did all of this. How would some kid even know how to put on boot-style camp drills and keep the group organized? It looks like the work of someone who ran military units. What makes me skeptical of this being some sort of FBI operation attempting to root out white nationalists is because it's a very nonviolent group. When posting about their marches, they always highlight that they were peaceful and conducted safely. They seek police escorts, and in one instance, when counter-protesters engaged them, they ended their march to avoid any sort of violent conflict. One would think if this group is part of some sort of FBI operation, they would be attempting to engage in violence or illegal activity of some sort. For years, the FBI has run sting operations within the Muslim community in an attempt to root out terrorists. They would infiltrate Muslim communities, and once a person is deemed a suspect, the FBI would run a sting operation and often supply everything that was needed. For example, in 2009, a group of four Muslim men known as the Newberg Four were charged with plotting to bomb two Jewish synagogues and shoot missiles at military supply planes. However, it turns out there was an FBI informant among them who basically schemed the whole thing and roped these men into it for money. He suggested the plot and the targets, bought the gun, provided the fake bombs and missile, assembled the explosive devices, and drove them around. The Fort Dix Five was another FBI-planned plot to attack New Jersey Army Base Fort Dix. The FBI informants plotted everything and supplied the weapons. The men who were convicted were really only guilty of being Muslim and expressing their disgust with the American wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. But nonetheless, the country had an appetite to find and stop terrorists, and so overzealous law enforcement went to work. With the growing narrative of far-right white nationalists and Trump supporters being the country's greatest threat, we've seen the same FBI entrapment tactics being used. The attempted kidnapping of Governor Gretchen Whitmer is one recent example where it was discovered that at least 12 undercover informants played major roles in the scheme. The Biden administration and Democrats in general are bent on selling this threat to the American public, so it makes sense why so many would be suspicious about whether or not organizations such as Patriot Front are actually real. So I can't say whether or not they are, but I can say from looking through their sites and watching their videos that if they are supported by someone unidentified, it's likely someone with military training and definitely someone with money. So I'm curious if you guys think kind of looking at all of this, I mean, look, these kids, they have shields, like the police-style riot shields, and they're painted in red, white, and blue, and they all have uniforms, they have training camps. It's just there's clearly money behind this group. There's not very many of them. This group is small. It's only a few hundred people maybe around the country. I'm curious if you think looking at this, do you think this is possibly an FBI operation, or do you think this is real? I mean, the fact they came into U-Hauls is extremely suspicious. None of them had trucks. So basically, if you were going to be the FBI, or some agency, probably the FBI, and you were going to organize something like this, all of the boxes that you would check are being checked here. It doesn't mean that that's what happened, but that's really like not carrying weapons, not engaging the protesters in any type of violence that could escalate because those would be rules of engagement that as a law enforcement person you're not supposed to do. Showing up in a U-Haul because if you show up in, or a rented van because if you show up in your own, then people can figure that out and trace it back. Like all of these things, plus Rogan's like, it just doesn't scan type of thing. And to say that these may be feds is not to discredit the idea that there is a problem with white supremacist militias around the country. People should not take that away from that point. The feds infiltrated and propped up all sorts of left-wing socialist and civil rights groups in the 50s and the 60s, which does not mean that there were not organic, real civil rights and socialist organizations. It just means that this is what the feds do. Yeah. And you could say the same thing about what the feds were doing throughout the aughts when they were infiltrating mosques, etc., etc. Which, by the way, interestingly. Right. There are certain, it's, it's of course the case that there are, you know, terrorists that exist in the world. But also it is the case that the feds gin up stuff because they're no good at their jobs. So they have to fake things so that they can then, you know, trick idiots into, into giving them a press conference. And that's the, the parallel with what we know about the Whitmer plot. Like that is really interesting. And it is very unfortunate for the FBI that that was so easy to sort of unravel. And similarly, this one is looking like when you have these glaring red flags, like U-Hauls and uniforms, etc. Like it's making it really easy to identify. And there's a question of whether they're that dumb, open question. But, but I would say it's possible that like the Whitmer plot, it's a combination of both. And that you have somebody who is, is putting these ideas in the ears of people. Like, hey, we should do U-Hauls. And there are sincerely people in this group that believe the noxious things that the group purports to believe. And then the last thing I'll add is one thing that's alarming to me is how, how in sync a lot of wealthy establishment people in this country with money are with the feds now. And it is entirely possible to me that they would put money behind this just on their own. If you look at, you know, NBC, MSNBC, I mean, it's full of feds. And like the Lincoln Project types love these types of people. And so I could just see that happening without the feds even needing to at this point, actually nudge it along. Yeah. I mean, the big question is how big of a threat are these things really though? So yes, do these things exist? You know, yes. Do terrorists exist in all forms? Yes. But how large of a threat? What are we, the American people, willing to give up or willing to do to others in order to root out that threat? You know, so something like this, a group like this, you know, they're going around the country, they're doing these marches, they're wearing these white masks that are kind of reminiscent of white hoods. Right. So it kind of gives you that visual of, oh my gosh, these are, you know, they're organized, they're marching with these flags and these shields and they're, they're scary. They're covered with these white masks. And it's, the optics of it is very frightening for people to see this happening at the nation's Capitol or in Philadelphia or in Salt Lake City or in Nashville, you know, all around the country. The optics of it are very, very scary. So, but you know, look, I grew up in Idaho. I have to say we had actual white supremacist camps in Idaho. They had parades every year. They were allowed to have those parades. The ACLU fought on their behalf to have those parades. They were nonviolent. We ignored them. I never saw a single one of those parades. I never ran into a single one of them. I mean, even though those camps existed, they're no longer there. But even though that existed where I grew up, it was literally, I mean, it was just no threat to us. It was, they could be ignored. And this is the kind of group that if it is real and not some sort of FBI operation, I mean, I just think they're not a real threat. They're not doing anything. They've got wacky ideas that are really backwards that the vast majority of America are not going to agree with. There's no threat of this ideology growing inside of the American public. Even on the right, they're not going to agree that no, America should just be European. I just don't think they're a threat at all. It's just not a real threat. I do think that, I think the ideology is a real thing, but I do think this particular group was fabricated. So you're believing that it's, you think it's fake. Those particular clowns I kind of do. It's very, very polished. It might not be, I don't know, but it just doesn't, smells off. Rogan and Tayibi, great combination though. I haven't listened to it yet. That was fun. Anyway, we will have more Rising right after this."

So I assume that the U-Hauls are about to re-enter and pick them up this way. But again, we'll see. We've got to leave now. We can't do that. This is not a good idea. We've got to leave now. We've got to wait for it. I mean, I'm not going to lie to you. You've got to make sure that you mess it up. You've got to mess it up. You've got to mess it up. You've got to mess it up. You've got to mess it up. You've got to mess it up. Good evening, guys. If you're just tuning in, this is News to Share out in Washington, DC right now videoing, streaming Patriot Front, standing up to the police. We're not exactly sure what's going on. We're just tuning in to see what goes down out there. We're just tuning in to see what goes down out there. We're just tuning in to see what goes down out there. We're just tuning in to see what goes down out there. Hey, guys. If you're just tuning in, this is Jamie bringing you a stream from News to Share back in Washington, DC. Apparently, he- this is Patriot Front, and we're not exactly sure what is going on. So we're just kind of tuning in to see where this goes. This is Patriot Front marching in DC, but we're not exactly sure why they've halted, why the police are there, or what the details are. We're tuning in to see where this goes. We're just tuning in to see where this goes. We're just tuning in to see where this goes. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Again, to the people who are watching, the reason that this has just been sort of standing here is they've marched basically to the Capitol and then back across the bridge into Virginia. And so at this spot, the MPD is basically protecting them as they're waiting for what I assume is the same transport that took about half of them earlier. So when they marched across earlier, about half of them got into two U-Haul trucks that then drove away, like moving trucks. And it looks like the police are starting to move, so it might happen soon. But basically, it's been like a half hour, maybe, of the other half of them just standing there, presumably waiting for those moving trucks to return for them. And so they've just been standing there with shields apparently waiting to be picked up as the media and a couple of, you know, a handful of counter-protesters, you know, sort of stand across the police line from them. But basically, this has been a stalemate as they wait for what I assume is those same trucks to return and get them. Thank you. Panic. It's a Sony 4K camera. I can't partner. How long is it? I've changed it three times tonight for whatever that's worth. I think I've been out here like two hours. Something like that. So oh god that one was a mess. Oh you didn't know about that? You just you showed up like I was on it. I was on I was on I was in an uber back because my scooter ran out of battery. Who do you shoot for? Um usually the Atlanta Journal but they're not going with us. Right. I mean you couldn't have come up here for this because like nobody. Oh cool. I love meeting new people. I mean if you're going to school at Georgetown for journalism or something like reach out anytime seriously I'd have a lunch or a beer or something. I cover most of congress now. I uh I've got the congressional press pass. Sometimes I mean I'm not. It really is. I'm making fun of it. Like that's how I actually make money. No I know. Um. I send my photos to Shutterstock and they sell them to campaigns. Right. But they are the most boring standard photos. Yeah. Yeah so I heard through the radio thing as they were talking about it. I think what happened is basically so there were the two U-Hauls that picked these guys up before and that was like half of them. They drove away and I heard the cops talking about it and they were like. So I think what happened is they drove away to drop them off somewhere and they couldn't find their way back. And so I think that's why basically everyone's waiting. A couple times now the cops have said here we go. Like as if this is the time that the things are going to enter and then they pick you up. What's the I presume once they start getting the U-Hauls they're going to move up and kind of force them back to the bus? Well I mean they got into it on their own. I don't think they. I mean I just don't imagine there's a police line here. They're not going to. They're here to make sure nobody gets in their way as they do it. When these guys did basically the exact same stuff. The police were not as well prepared and like basically these guys ended up like. I'm buying a C70 just for the show. They did this in Philly once and they also did this. They did this basically this exact exact stunt here in DC in February 2020. Like a year and a half ago or so. No I know what you're talking about. I wasn't at that one. I yeah I didn't get to physically go to Georgia as much. I had a freelancer who filmed a couple of those but didn't get the interior of the Capitol. I did go to one of the events outside the Capitol on like December 10th. I got lucky. I mean I was got sent home in spring break. It was like March 10th. Right on home of the Black Lives Matter protest. I started doing freelancing work. Then came the Georgia stuff and I was just constant stuff. All my classes were online. They were like oh you have a job to do. Just go do it. Nobody cared about this mess. I would never have gotten a contract as a college student. It's not. Nobody cares. I feel like Jordan was decent but it's not like not that one. I co-founded this company in college. At American University. I don't know. I got rejected from AU and GW. Interesting. And got into Georgetown early access. Really Georgetown's just. Yeah yeah. Was it early decision or early. Early access. Like I applied to all. Like the one where you still get the choice. Yeah. Now I'm in school with Gabe Fleischer. Are you. Is this a grad program or is it. Undergrad. I'm actually applying for a grad program this year. Democracy and Democrats. I do an election program. Also at Georgetown. Yeah. And then Columbia for Dartmouth. I have a scholarship that lets me do a T-Grad program for free. Personally I don't really care which one. I'm just gonna. Well you're gonna be. I got you. No that's exactly. That was my whole plan was like. I need to be ready to go. Like right after I graduated. And I was like wait they're both running and I'm not doing this. I think it's all good. I'm expecting. I'm surprised there isn't something for the sixth day. Oh you mean the J6 anniversary. Yeah. My. Well my live audience can probably hear what I'm saying. I don't think that there's any reason. The actual. People who did J6. Oh I don't think we're gonna. No. I think there'll be like a free the J6 type thing. They could do that. That could happen again. Like they did on September 18th. That could happen again. But I also feel like. Like maybe a progressive. Like you know it's been one year and there hasn't been any kind of justice. That kind of you know point of view as a. I don't know I'm thinking of black bob type thing. No no no. Not at the. That's not as popular anymore. Liberal type. Limits my choice. Not not a line. No I know. Have you only covered in Georgetown and DC? I'm sorry not Georgetown. Georgia and DC. Mostly I occasionally went out to the south. But I work for Delta now so I fly everywhere. I'm getting my firefighter training later this spring. It'll hopefully cover some. I'm taking this fall off to cover the governor's check with Amherst. Oh cool. That's how many I like. My uncle is in Atlanta. It's. Me honestly. It's a pretty chill season. You're actually like. I would I would kind of disagree as it relates to political activism. Oh yeah. No talking campaigns. Campaigns. Campaigns. But like. Protests and things like. They may pick up. The trials. Will happen in the summer. All of the big. Because like it's not. I'm kind of glad I didn't get a squirt than I thought about it. You know Cole Howard? He's out there a lot. Cole Howard. He's a film guy. So a bunch of the film guys in Atlanta. Because like a huge film community. They were all put on leave because of COVID. And they all have to have a really nice nice nice cameras. So they all became photojournalists for six months. It was hilarious. That is true. Like literally they go all back to like working now making 150k a year. Like one of them was like literally an electrician. Like he does the electric boxes for. For film directors. I have no idea. I'm going to get that bus ticket or something. Should I get an Uber? No. I don't get like why. They show up by surprise in various cities. Yeah I was trying to do that with other people's you know videos. Which were like sketchy. But. They get mad at you for filming their faces? Well they're all their faces are covered. I mean I heard one of the. So last last time I covered them. I said. Burnouts. I licensed the footage to CNN. Well I think they recognize me here. Because one of them goes. Who are you going to send the footage to? Oh I saw that on the. He said something like that to me. And so I you know. What do you want to? Like but yeah. Again they're not going to. They're not going to. This is going to get five hundred. Because they're asking. I mean I got my mask. Just I have a riot kit that I bring with me. That I have with me in my closet. I have my bunk cap. I have my bunk cap. I have my gas mask. I'm like you know what just in case. Yeah. But I didn't think it was. Also one problem with. These I don't have a car. I everything I go. I go via scooter. So like I used to be when I was in Atlanta. I literally kept my right. It's in the back of my car. Always now I'm like I have a right. Keep my door in a closet. Where well I mean like not super specific. But like what neighborhood? Uh I I was um. I was at the Costco in Mount Vernon. I was on an Uber back to Georgetown. When I heard about it. Just like literally from Georgia. So it's not that bad. I got on M Street. And like literally like. Sure. Right right. So it takes me like 15 minutes to get to the center. But I thought they were at the monument. So I went all the way down. And then started seeing the lights over here. And then I there was just. I've been around people. And we've seen very happy. You know like they were. They were like. I got that. I got that. I got that. Right. They so I heard about it. When they were I think already at the. I didn't know they were. Based out of the city. Yeah. Do they fly a lot then? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. It's not a bad idea. To plan some things. What's like the minimum number of hours. 150. Per month. Per year. 50 a year. The problem is it's really hard to get the job. Like it is. It's a stroke test. You have to do background check. You have to get through everything. But once you get it like. I keep educating him and not me. I always beg you for education. I beg you and you never tell me. 150 hours a year. I keep educating him and not me. What's going on here? No we're just talking about the. It's been a long time. It's been a long time. I'm just like. I'm just like. I'm just like. I'm just like. It'd be nice. I don't think so. The National Guard got mad at me for talking to them. I'm sure they declared. Actually I was in front of them when they came around. And that's why I got in there. Just walk them over. So you're a student? Yeah. You're? You're this class. But I work. I cover Congress. Do you have an obstacle course? I always carry around. I just switch over to all people. And so every bag I have. That's my duffel. My backpack. My like literally my wallet. It has at least an MPPA. Right. I have the MPPA. I'm not judging. I have a school driving. So. Go to USC school of journalism. So much fun out of LA. I didn't realize you were just going to be. So. So hey guys. Just as a. Update. This is news to share in Washington D.C. right now. And they are. Something is going on with Patriot Front earlier. They were. Earlier they were. What do you call it? Marching on the Capitol. And I'm not exactly sure what that entailed. But now apparently they're just kind of waiting for. A pickup is kind of what I hear. So we're just watching and waiting to see how this goes down. They're standing there with shields and such. They're just waiting. So earlier we heard News2Share say something about a U-Haul had came and picked up half of the guys already and so they were likely waiting for their ride to get picked up out of there. These guys are probably just showing that the leader of Patriot Front just had a conversation with MPD's Commander Glover of Special Operations Division, who I assume is the highest ranking officer on site, so presumably he's the commanding officer here. No idea what was said, but they had that conversation and now they're basically having a little MPD puddle. So it seemed to me before that basically half of them were picked up by U-Hauls and what seemed to me is that probably those U-Hauls were going to return to pick up the rest of them. They just had some kind of conversation. For now we've been standing here for probably about an hour watching these guys basically just stand there with shields, wait, and so they just had a conversation. It's not like the police are moving aside to let that truck in. So you know, absolutely no idea what the expiration on this is going to be. The reason why, I don't know if you're asking me why they're called fascist. The only reason why it's titled fascist is so we don't get taken down for glorifying groups that big tech have labeled as white supremacists. I don't know what's going on here. And they haven't done anything that's dangerous or white supremacy in any way that I've seen. Are they wearing masks? What does it look like from here they're wearing like scream style masks? I didn't see them marching but those are not cops. Those are, that's Patriot Front with the shields. Patriot Front is the one, are the ones with the shields. Are they wearing masks? What does it look like to you that they're wearing masks? Coverings but they're all identical. Yeah. It's like either a head, something on the head or. They're being very patient, you know, like whatever they're waiting for, they're being very patient over there just standing around with their shields. So earlier, take a look at what happened earlier. This was earlier when they were actually marching. So this is what it looked like earlier on in the day when they were marching. It looks like they're marching through the mall. That looks like, it looks like they're marching through the mall right earlier. That was about two hours ago. Victory or death. It looks like that sign says victory or death. Another sign that says reclaim America. They're all dressed very uniformly and khakis and a black sweatshirt or jacket of some sort. Thank you, Gabby. You're so sweet. Let's start the super chat for Mrs. BCP. Thank you so much. You're so sweet. I appreciate you. And then at some, it does look very regime like. And then at some point. That was earlier on. It looks like they marched through the whole mall. And then. Yeah, gosh, I remember marching through this, not marching. I remember running through this, trying to follow Franklin Graham through this whole entire mall when I was seven months pregnant back in September of 2020. That's a long distance, y'all. I think it's like two miles. Trying to keep up with him. And it looked like he was walking just regular speed. But he had so many people around him and he had somebody in front of him like, you know, people in front of him trying to divide the crowd so he could get through. And it felt like I literally ran the entire time from one end of the mall all the way to the end. And he would stop and pray a certain specific at certain designated areas. He would pray and I would get like caught up and catch my breath. And, you know, off we go. Off he'd go. And I felt like I was running, trying to keep up with him. It was crazy. Quincy was running, trying to video it. It was it was it was intense. So this was earlier on. This was about an hour and a half ago where they were marching through the mall. Very peaceful. Lots of American flags there. They've got their drum going. It's not like a chanting type drum, which I always appreciate. It's not that really drawn, drawn out, demonic drum they've got. It's more upbeat. Citizen 445 on Twitch. This is apparently Patriot Prayer in Washington, D.C. right now. Earlier about an hour and a half ago, they were marching through the mall to the Capitol. So they started at one end. It looks like they're coming up here on the Lincoln Memorial, doing some doing some chants like Reclaim America, Victory or Death, things like that as they kind of marched through. They marched across the bridge from Washington, D.C. back into Virginia. Yeah, I don't think I called it Patriot Prayer. It's Patriot Front. Did I call it Patriot Prayer? I'm sorry. It's Patriot Front. Oh, I'm sorry. It's Patriot Front. My bad. So, Patriot Prayer is here. This is Patriot Front. People say that they're white supremacists. I would disagree with that. I think they're just people who love the country and they're probably like American nationalists. So it was very peaceful here as they're walking. They're marching back across the bridge. I think I saw this earlier. This was about a little over an hour ago. So I don't know if they marched from Virginia into Washington, D.C. and back or if they um, hello, status quo, and say hi to you. I don't know if they started in Washington, D.C., went into Virginia, and back or whatnot. Thank you so much. Cow, gal, hair character dancing under a rain of confetti. Oh, I think that's a sticker and it's describing what it is. I can't actually see the sticker, but it's describing what it is with confetti. You are amazing. Thank you so much. I really appreciate you. So yeah, that's a really great picture of them marching across the bridge. They're on their way back into Virginia at this point. And then something happened between here and where they're at right now, still just standing with their shields. Something happened between here and wherever they got to where they stopped. It sounds like News2Share said that a couple of U-Hauls came and actually picked up about half of the guys and took off. And then, um, since then, the remaining individuals have been just standing there with their shields, I guess, waiting for the ride to show up. Is what is thought to be happening. There hasn't been a whole lot of communication with Patriot Prayer from News2Share, so I'm not exactly sure. I'm sorry, Patriot Front. Why am I keep saying that? He's like, stop saying Patriot Prayer. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for the super chat, share. You're a beacon. I absolutely love the strength and light you show us all. Thank you. Thank you to you and your hubby. Thank you so much, share. I really appreciate you. That is the sweetest thing ever. Thank you. If this isn't a false flag, then okay. I'm not exactly sure what their motivation was for being out here. Oh, one second. Let's see. What was just going on. Um, you know, nothing's changed in the last hour, really. Basically, they, you know, these people march through D.C. and then, you know, came back across the bridge here, New of Lincoln Memorial over to the Virginia side. So we're sort of near Arlington National Cemetery. And about half of them got into two U-Haul moving vans, which then drove those half of them away. And so about an hour later, the other half of them are standing there with shields as I presume they are waiting for those U-Hauls to return and get the rest of them. But, you know, the police are basically just standing in their way. You know, it might be happening soon because I heard one of the police cars, you know, turn on the engine. So maybe it's going to move and the U-Haul comes in. But who knows? Thank you so much, Dar. At some point, I presume that that vehicle will arrive to get the rest of them. Thank you so much, so much, so much. I have absolutely no idea when that's going to happen and it's been an hour. So, yeah, like News2Share said just now is not a whole lot has changed in the last hour. I cannot imagine standing there just waiting. Like, okay, so he said nothing's changed in the last hour. So if we go back here, it's been over an hour since they've been standing there. Okay, so here they are marching across the bridge and they're coming to a stop on the other side of the bridge, not really far off the bridge, and they're just hanging out there. And so this was at about an hour 17 ago and nothing has changed since then. They've just kind of posted up and they are waiting for something or someone. So that was about an hour and 17 ago and nothing has changed since then. They've stood there with their shields for a while. It looks like they had them up kind of protecting their upper bodies and their faces. But since then, now when we look at it, where they're at now, they no longer have the shields up. They are more just sitting on the ground, not really protecting themselves. And so this is where it stands. The Patriot Front is standing there almost an hour and a half now waiting and we're not exactly sure what they're waiting on. Okay. Okay. Okay. Got it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You know, I'm not exactly sure what the point of this is. We're trying to see where this goes. Earlier today, if you're just tuning in, about two hours ago, Patriot Front began marching through the mall from the Capitol in Washington, D.C., all the way across the bridge back into Virginia. And since then, they have been just kind of posted up. Here. Just on the other side of the bridge for about an hour and a half with no movement. It was said by News2Share that a couple of U-Haul vans pulled up and picked up about half of their group. And then, I don't know, it seems like they may have picked up even more than half. I can't tell if there's two or three rows of guys there. But it looked like there was quite a few people marching earlier. And so these guys have just been waiting. And we're not exactly sure what they're waiting for or what's going on. Total false flag. Explain that. What do you mean by that? I'm going to put an insert name here. I've got to tell you that— What's going on? Kate, stop. Stop. It's for little things. What makes you think that Patriot Front is not a good group? What have they done to deserve the name of white supremacists? What has gone on? I know that there have been a few things that, like, some spray paintings that have gone on, like, that said to be from Patriot Front. But are they? His name is the actual name of the guy. So with that said, as far as, like, what a false flag is, how is this a false flag if we've just got some people, some patriots that get together and decide to march? It's not much different than, like, any other rally. It's remained peaceful the entire time. They've just been very American-like, just marching with their flags. The drum sounded very marching band-like and with some chants in there. I don't think I would call them chants, but some kind of— Man, it's Saturday. I am tired. I wouldn't call them chants, like encouraging something or another, you know, just like, give me liberty or give me death or reclaim America or whatever it may be, just different things. Who needs to be blocked? Yo, man, who needs to be blocked? On Facebook. What is white supremacy about this? I don't understand. Like, Griffin James, just white supremacy at its finest, what does that even mean? Like, explain that to me. What do you mean by it's just white supremacy at its finest? What's the definition for that? They're not patriots. Why? Why aren't they? Their whole thing is showing up to places to do flash mobs so that they can film themselves, but nobody's really going to have to work hard to fight against them because nobody knows it's coming. You have a napper, just waking up from a nap. But usually they manage to do that in a rush. Usually they don't just sit here waiting for the flag to come back and get the other half. Okay, so this is only half of them? This is half of them. Yeah, half of them already left. They've been standing there for about... They've been standing there for about... You lost another tooth? Which one is that? What are you even eating that's red? That tooth? Uh-huh, it's red all over your mouth. I don't think... That's fine. I'm done. Got a tooth lost. Got another tooth. Another tooth bites the dust. He swallowed... The first tooth he ever lost, he swallowed. He just swallowed it. He was gone. I did not work out today. I am so tired. I can't stop yawning. I can't stop yawning. I tell you, they are not patriots. Well, I know something different. That I can tell you. So, I mean... You gotta come with some... Something. White face covering could be misconstructed as white supremacy. It could be. And a black face covering could be misconstrued as black face. I mean, it's a lose-lose situation these days because everybody always wants to read more into things, right? I mean, what are they supposed to wear? A yellow one could... Any color could be, you know, construed as some type of offense. But even if it wasn't, let's say they wore a blue one, right? Because it's not really a color... Well, you could say maybe they're supporting the thin blue line. Let's say they pick green. But green's not really like your normal, natural, neutral color. Like, a neutral color would be a white, tan, khaki-type color or black. But, like you said, the white could be construed as white supremacy. The black could be construed as black face. Khaki, maybe they don't even make that color. But they're choosing to wear khaki pants. Well, they're white supremacists because they're dressing all the same. Or because they're wearing khakis. Or, you know, everybody is constantly reading more into something when really it might just be a normal choice. You know, like, black or white is kind of like the two main choices for things. Black, white, and brown. Like, what color are your shoes? Likely black, white, or brown. I mean, you've got other colors, you know, like blue and gray and orange and red and hot pink and all these other options. Typically the more neutral, widely chosen colors are going to be black, white, and brown. And everybody wants to read more into stuff. And it just seems ridiculous and unnecessary. It causes undue stress. It causes undue confusion. It causes undue dysfunction and disagreement. And it just doesn't make any sense, you know. Don't read Wikipedia. Read their website. Yeah, I'll have to go look at their website. But as far as, like, some of the ones that I've actually met myself, not what, not at all what people would say they are. So, and being a nationalist isn't a racist thing. So, being a nationalist is kind of normal, actually. If you look at other countries, they're definitely nationalists. Asian culture is like nationalist ideology is like deeply rooted into their culture, right? They carried Nazi flags at a Unite the Right rally. What's a Nazi flag? Does it have a swastika on it? Hopefully you're not talking about the Confederate flag. We do not do the Tooth Fairy. We don't do any imaginary characters that would cause us to lie to them. But giving them money for a lost tooth is not unheard of. I've gotten, oh wait, did I see something about Optimus Prime? Is Optimus in here? It's been a long time. Optimus, are you there? I was just thinking about you the other day. Is it time to go? Oh, we're going to be heading. So, our oldest son turned 16. He got his learner's permit and he's out there on the road just cutting up. No, he's not really. He is out there learning how to drive. But he's celebrating his birthday today, although it was a couple weeks ago. Going to the trampoline. Him and some friends are going to the trampoline facility where you get to jump and do all that stuff. How can you tell what group they are? I'm not sure. Everybody has their kind of style. Different groups have different styles, I guess. You guys, you know, I'm so... Common sense is such a big deal to me. Logic, logics are such a big deal. Okay, stop, dear. Okay, you have to put it like right here. So, logic is such a big deal to me that I try not to read into things. And I don't think about what other people's beliefs are. Like, when I'm getting to know somebody or I'm talking to somebody, I'm not really thinking about what their cultural stance or their political stance is. I'm just trying to get to know who they are, right? And a lot of times, you know, if you think somebody has voted for, say, Biden or Trump, it does kind of give you an idea. So, Tommy Russo, again, the leader of Patriot Front and a self-avowed fascist, just sort of put his hands up to gesture to the police to come up and talk to him and then said something to them and then kind of resented back into his group. And then the police will leave whatever that message is to the rest of them. So, no idea what it was, but they had something to communicate, it appears right now. Okay, so it sounds like News2Share just witnessed one of the Patriot Front people raise his hand as if to come here, shared some communication with the officer, and then retreated back to where they were. The officer went back and shared whatever the message was, but we still don't know exactly what the message was. Now, what I was saying is, like, logic, being logical, rational, human nature, common sense, all those things are really important to me, and I think that we should let them factor into people's decisions and actions more often than we do as a people. It doesn't really make sense to constantly be reading into everything and think that something, because if you go looking for something, you're going to find it, right? Or you're going to find something that will justify whatever you're looking for, even if it doesn't make sense, because you're looking for it. So, that's one of the reasons why, like, when you read the Bible, you shouldn't go in reading the Bible. So, it sounds like they have a vehicle in the area that shouldn't be there. They're contemplating calling a tow truck. They were asking around to see if it belonged to somebody. The more reading into stuff we do, that's when you come up with assumptions. Like, for instance, earlier today I was at the store, and this lady, I started talking to her. I asked her, I was watching something pretty neat going on in Olympia, Washington, and I asked her if she was a patriot, and she got confused, whatever. Anyways, I was showing her this bunch of motorcycles carrying flags and rolling through Olympia, Washington. And she asked me, are they right-wingers? So, you know, it was that thing where she automatically had preconceived notions that come with right-wing, and she didn't really care about what they were doing, because all of a sudden it didn't matter who they were, what they believed. They didn't even matter anymore, because they were considered right-wing. And then she looked at me, and she says to me, well, I see you're not wearing a mask, so obviously you're not vaccinated. So, it's like one of those things where I really get irritated when people make assumptions, or they bring in their preconceived notions, which are typically garbage. I don't have any problems with stereotypes. I think stereotypes can be absolutely hilarious more often than not. When it comes to racial stereotypes, gender stereotypes, you know, all those things, I think they can be super funny, and a lot of times they're super true. And it's just, I don't have any problems with that. But, you know, at the end of the day, if we're not going to take the time to get to know people for who they are, not just based on what their beliefs are, what their cultural beliefs are, or their political stance, then really, what is the point? So, I tried to talk to that lady. I thought we were going to become friends. And, you know, after she found out that I supported Trump, she turned her back to me and wouldn't speak to me for the rest of the time that we were in line. And so I finally just moved to another line. And I had actually let somebody else behind me go over, because I could have been helped first, but I let some people go behind me, because I thought that we were going to engage in conversation and, you know, she seemed really nice. But once she found out about my political and my cultural kind of stance, she turned her back to me. Like, literally turned her back to me and didn't have anything left to say to me. And it's stupid. It's stupid. And it's people like that that don't make sense to me. Like, I just do not care to be accused. So when people are constantly accusing, like, these particular individuals of being white supremacists, I don't know them. And I'm not the kind of person who's just going to throw white supremacy and racism around willy-nilly, because that's what makes the word itself and the actual actions themselves lose weight, right? Because then when you say something's racist, it's like, eh, whatever, you know, because it's been thrown around so much that nobody cares anymore. It's just like, well, you've just overused the word and you're calling stupid things racist that aren't really racist. So it's just ridiculous. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes, there you are. Hello, hello. Welcome. It's been a long time. I hope you're doing well. I hope you are doing well. It's good to see you again. How much of this thing is transphobic? I mean, I highly doubt that there's anybody out there who's actually afraid of a transgender individual. I highly doubt it. You can't just add phobic onto the end of whatever word. I mean, that's not how that works. It's got to mean something. It's got to mean something. Like, say what you mean, mean what you say. Don't throw stupid words out there. Add an ism on the end or phobic on the end or whatever and think that you have made up some new thing. It's not a new thing. It's a stupid thing. That's what it is. Who's who? Okay, so anybody who's just tuning in, what we have here going on is this is News2Share live in Washington, D.C. right now. Earlier, a group known as Patriot Front took to marching in the capital. They marched through the mall. This is just a quick overview. It looks like police officers were actually, almost looks like they were marching with them. Looks like the bike, if you see the bikes over there on the other side of them. I'm not sure if their own people were on bikes. There's actually quite a few of them. Oh, yeah, this is definitely the police. So they were escorting them. So it must have been a permitted event. So they, you know, marched through the mall. It was a quite a long march. They went from D.C., marched from the capital down to the Lincoln Memorial, or yeah, Lincoln Memorial, and then cut across the bridge and marched back over into Virginia, where News2Share stated a couple of U-Haul vans stopped and picked, I mean, came to pick about half their group up. There's quite a few of them, though. I mean, if you see this, if you're looking at this here, I was going to come back. There's quite a few of them. I mean, that's a pretty large portion of people marching. This is them marching across the bridge. Marching across the bridge back into Virginia. And then once they got on the other side is when they kind of posted up. It's been an hour and 40 minutes now. They kind of posted up and have been there ever since. And the police are just kind of standing around waiting, as are we, to see what happens. It looks like they may be waiting for their ride. There has been some communication between them and the police just recently. They first started with their shields kind of up, protecting in the protective stance of their upper bodies and their faces. And now, you know, as you see, they're just kind of standing more of a relaxed position with their shields down. There hasn't been any unpeaceful. It's been peaceful the entire time. There haven't been any negative things going on. We're just not sure. I mean, where do these people, where do they transport them? To Ohio and back? I'm not sure. Not sure what they're doing. So we're just kind of hanging out and seeing what comes of it. Oh, the U-Haul van has shown up. So there's another U-Haul that has showed up now. And this is what News2Share said took the first half of the group. So it looks like we may be seeing them take the other part. The video is live right now. You can go to News2Share, Amazing Grace, and see the earlier part of the video. But it is actually live right now. This is News2Share live in Washington, D.C. Please stop doing that. I didn't think you could ride in the back of a U-Haul either. It seems unsafe, I guess. I mean, I thought it was going to be like a van. I didn't know it was going to be like a van with no windows or doors. With no windows. I didn't think that was legal. I'm like a jungle gym. My kids use me as a jungle gym. I don't think every parent can relate to that. Thanks for tuning in with me tonight, guys. As we kind of just wait to see. It looks like some of them are gone now. Okay, hold on. Did you guys see them leave? There was a bunch over here on the side. That has definitely dwindled down. Hold on a second. Yeah, they definitely filled that up. Okay, here's where the van rewound a little bit. This is a lot how illegals do it, I think. That's a pretty long van, so they are definitely pulling up. I am really surprised that the police are allowing a U-Haul van, a moving van to pull up and load a bunch of people in and take off. I'm surprised. Are there no laws against that? So this is where we're seeing actually quite a few of them take off and get into the van. So what's going to happen now is that took an hour and 40 minutes, guys. They were standing out there from the last time some of their group was picked up. From what News2Share had to say. It's been about an hour and 40 minutes since they've been standing there. Maybe an hour 45. So is there going to be another hour and 45 minutes before this last group of people? Look at them. That's them kind of loading into that van there. Maybe they own it. That's crazy. Yeah, different state laws. It's legal in Florida. Interesting. Well, you know what? That's the beauty. So BCP was just telling me today that Germany is going to go back into lockdown come February, and they will start going door to door with injections. One of the things I was saying about the United States is that we have a very unique situation here where although we operate as a unit, the Constitution was written very deliberately to make sure that no one person could take control over the entire unit, meaning the 50 states. So it would be really hard for what's happening in Germany to happen here across the country because of the separation of powers. So the federal law separated from state law. And it will be really hard to get any Republican-run states or any Democrat-run states that have a conscience or any set of morals at all to join in in going door to door and forcing something on people that they don't want within their homes. So it would be really hard to do that here in the United States in every state. So Coco Rosie, what woman are you talking about? Are you talking about me? If you are, do tell. Do explain what you're talking about. Individual states can – yes, me. Well, first of all, what do you mean? What world am I living in? Regarding what topic? Be more specific. I haven't met one person so far that can read minds. So be more specific in your comments. You can ride in an RV without seat belts. Yes, this is true. But also in the states, you know, governors are ever-changing. So you may have Rhonda Santus in Florida today, but who are you going to have in 2022? And who are you going to have in the next election, right? Governor Kate Brown in Oregon, her time is getting ready to be up, and we have an election coming up in 2022. And her term limit is up, so she's not going to be able to stay there. And we do see, like in Virginia, where a Democrat state may be flipped to Republican. So, like I said, there's different things going on when it comes to the Constitution and separation of powers and how every state has the right to make their own rules. So what's going to happen in Germany is not necessarily going to be able to happen across the entire unit here because you have those different state laws. Our government does not operate in accordance with our Constitution anymore. They do, to a certain degree. I wouldn't say that it's completely thrown out. I mean, I think you're wrong on that, so I'm not sure what world you're living in. We still have state laws. In fact, we just saw it in the Rittenhouse trial. We see it in Florida. We see it in Texas. We see it in Oregon. As horrible as it is here, they get to act tyrannous. That's a new word. They get to act in a certain way that another state isn't acting, and that is because of the Constitution. So you can say they don't act accordingly, but they do. They just don't do it in every single— every T isn't crossed, every I isn't dotted. They've definitely strayed in many areas, but that doesn't mean that they don't altogether. I mean, so what are you saying exactly? You're taking a couple of things that have happened during this whole Big C movement last year, and yeah, they definitely acted out of line. They've definitely overreached. Even the president of the United States has overreached, and we've seen that, where he came out and tried to put out this executive order across the entire unit, and so many people started suing OSHA. OSHA backed out. OSHA stood down. So again, that goes to show that they are operating in accordance with the Constitution, but they have, in fact, had some overreach. I mean, it is what it is, but it's not a total takedown yet. We are still protected by it to some degree, and if more people would stand up, we would have more protection, and we could use it. It's still there. It's still there. Kathy, well, why isn't BCP live? I am live. He's not there right now. We still have Mala here in Arkansas. Is that your governor? I don't know who the governor is. Oregon Dems will be on their way out. I don't think so. Kate Brown will be on her way out for sure, but I'm pretty sure Democrats will follow, will still be in position. I highly doubt that we're going to get a Republican governor here in Oregon. We've had mail-in voting for 25 years or more, actually, and ever since we had mail-in voting go into place, the state has flipped from red to blue and never looked back. And so I'm not sure that we will ever have a Republican governor here again. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. All right, I'm going to go ahead and I've got to take my son to his birthday party thing at Sky Zone, a big trampoline park. So I have your favorite guy, your favorite. Oh, and by the way, guys, I just want to point out, all day today, well, except for my – all day today I've been walking around in my – here, hold on. I've been walking around in my slippers. My pillow, my pillow slippers, they are amazing. They are super amazing, and I don't wear slippers, but I'll tell you what, these slippers stay on my feet, and when I'm at home they're on my feet. So your favorite guy is going to slide into the seat now. You guys are amazing. Thank you so much for hanging out with me, and I will see you soon. Okay. I'm not going to – we're not stopping the stream. I'm just going to slide out of the chair. That's all. The stream's still going to be here. Well, what do you mean? Okay. Okay. Okay. Basically, everybody except them only finds out that they're doing it when they're actually on the ground doing it. So my understanding is they marched across the same bridge as the white man over there to the Lincoln Memorial, then marched across the National Mall to the Capitol, and then basically did the same thing at the first, from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, and then back across the bridge down to here. They basically filled two giant U-Hauls with their people, and those two U-Hauls drove away. And then about an hour and maybe an hour and a half later, which is just a little bit ago, one of those U-Hauls – or it could be a different U-Haul, but I assume one of those U-Hauls showed back up here empty, and more of their people got into that and drove away. So what's left is what I imagine is about a fourth of them. I think they were probably trying to do a peace trip with their two U-Hauls, and then only one of them came back. So I think that the ones who are left here are basically the Lincoln. It's one of those two that they come back to, or that they leave. This entire time, the police were basically just standing there kind of creating a web, according to my focus readers, about 40 meters between the African-American front people and the police line that's basically being used as media. And I don't think there's any counterpart to that. But they don't go across the U-Haul. For a while it's been this, and it seems like it's going to continue to be this, but they're standing here as apparently they're looking for a U-Haul to take them back. Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? What's up, you guys? I think there's some... There is sound. I just had to turn... Yeah, there's sound. There's been sound on. I think it was potted down a little bit. So shout out to... In case you guys are wondering, I'm restreaming this myself, which I usually don't do that much, but I'm restreaming this from a News to Share. So that's who gets the props for this back in D.C. right now. Patriot Front, probably about an hour ago. We've been on about that long. We were just on YouTube and it popped up. I was like, oh, let's stream it. Patriot Front, that's who this is. And from my understanding, I've been busy doing stuff. Wifey's been in here talking to you guys, explaining things to you, what's been going on and whatnot. So let me see. Let me see something real quick. Making sure... Okay, I'll turn the volume up a little bit. There we go. So that's what's been going on back in D.C., again, Patriot Front. From my understanding, they marched to the Capitol and back across the bridge into Virginia. I mean, that's kind of a good little hike. But what I want to point out here, what I want to point out is I want you guys to pay attention to them. They've been standing in... I don't know the temperature in D.C. right now. Actually, let me look real quick. I mean, because we are in like fall headed to winter. So let me see what the temperature is right now in D.C. Okay, it's 50 degrees right now, 49 degrees. It's going to drop down into... looks like the nighttime might be 30, 35. So I mean, it's not cold, but it's obviously not hot. But look at them. There's no... and I'm going to say this, and some people may not like it. That looks intimidating. That there, right there, up here, that looks intimidating. Honestly, that looks like a force to be reckoned with, even though right there in that picture only looks about like 15. Like, they are not moving. They've been standing in that position since we've been streaming this. Seriously. So the patriot groups that are out there, I would say maybe learn something. And people are going to say that they're actors. Hold on just a moment. So, what, there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, until about 12, in between 10 and 15. They're not actors. They're not actors. Patriot Front isn't an acting group. From what I know, they are not an acting group. But if you look at them, which I'm going to have to go back and look at stuff from earlier to see them actually marching. But they are well... and again, let me go back to what I was saying. For the groups, the patriotic groups that are out there, this is something to pay attention to. Like, this looks serious. This looks like, yo, we are not messing around. You better take us serious. We're disciplined, we're trained, and we're not playing around. You have police officers in front of them, and they're standing in military-type position with shields that are all matching. They're all matching. Hey, fellas out there, patriot groups out there, look at them. They are matching. They're unidentifiable except for what they are all wearing, which is exactly the same. I've been saying this for a while, just like Antifa. Why aren't patriots all dressing up in red or blue or all white? These guys are getting it. They seriously get it. Antifa does all black. You can't identify them. Except that they're all black, and guess what? Police have a hard time. This is... whatever is going on with the Patriot Front group or whatever, I mean, personally, myself, I like it. For me, myself, I'm all about structure and routine, discipline, manners, patience. They say patience is a virtue. You can't... you might be able to dox this a little bit. I don't know. I mean, from here, you can't. From here, you can't really dox a person. You can't really dox a person. And if they're all wearing the same thing, if they're covered up, you're not going to be able to dox it anyway. And I know there's rumors out there that this is the hate group and this and that, but they've deemed other people hate groups. They've deemed street preachers hate groups. So the whole this is a hate group type of thing, I don't buy it. I don't buy it until I have my own interaction type of thing with people. I've had my interaction with the left. I've had my interaction with Antifa. Right? So I'm not going to deem this, and that's been my own personal thing. So I don't just go off what, you know, that's on websites or what the left says or what SLPC, whatever group that is, that deems every conservative a hate group, an extremist group. I don't go off that. But what I am going off of is the discipline that they have, the order, the structure. Like they're not out there smoking. They're not out there talking to people. Looks like they're out there for something that's serious. And I wouldn't be surprised if there's something that they could be maybe practicing for, maybe for coming up within the next month, almost exactly a month, exactly a month and two days. From my understanding, they did march to the Capitol today. In a month and two days, there is an anniversary coming up. Just saying, I don't know. I don't know anybody in the group. But that looks very serious. That looks serious. And for them to be actually facing law enforcement like they are? Just saying. Just saying. So I'm doing stuff. Wifey just stepped away. She had to go deal. She's taking the older son to kind of like celebrate his third birthday event tonight, party, whatever. No, it's fine. He didn't do it last weekend. So they're going to go there to a trampoline type park type thing and play around with some of his friends. And older little son, he went as well. And I have the rest of them. So and I'm doing some other stuff. So I want to be back and forth. We were not planning on going live tonight, and I'm still not planning on going live except for this. So this was for a moment. I just wanted to come on here and restream News to Share, which this is the original photographer who's out on the scene right now back in Washington, D.C. streaming this live. So, yeah. This will be interesting. I basically I think it's done with for the evening. There's not going to be anything because obviously they're well trained or well disciplined. And they're just standing there and police are there. So I don't think obviously anything is going to be coming of this. I'm trying to when I'm looking at the picture, I'm trying to get a sense of location of where it's at. But they did say it was back in Virginia because they did cross the bridge. Thank you. Was that slew it? Slew it. Investigate. Hopefully I said that right. Am I on rumble? The question. Thank you for the super chat, by the way. God bless you for that. Thank you very much. Are you on rumble yet? Yes. At the BC preacher. My pop wants to watch you, but he doesn't like Facebook or YouTube. We couldn't find you on rumble. Much love and respect to you and your family. Thank you very much. Blessings. Yes, I am on rumble at the BC preacher. I don't go live on rumble, though. I do not go live on rumble yet. I am also on telegram. So here you guys go. Telegram, Instagram, Twitter, rumble and Twitch. All of those are the same. Same handle. Everything is the same. And even the backup YouTube channel is the same. All of that is at the BC preacher. And most of that is all one word. Everything is actually one word. All together. At the BC preacher. So there, even if you want to find the other YouTube page, the backup channel, just in case anything happens to this in the future or whatever, Lord, you know, Lord forbid, hopefully not. Everything is the BC preacher. So I'm not sure why the cops are there, to be honest with you guys. I don't know exactly the whole story. I didn't see the whole footage. Again, this is on news to share their YouTube channel. Looks like some more police are pulling up. So we'll see what that's about. I don't know why the police are there. From my understanding, they were marching and they marched to the Capitol. I don't know if they actually were blocking streets or marching in the streets or whatnot. And they marched back from the Capitol. And this is where we tuned in at and started restreaming news to share. Looks like more police. I don't know if people are getting arrested. They brought a van there. From my understanding, the Patriot Front, they've been loading or getting into some sort of U-Hauls and being transported from this area to wherever. So I don't know what's going on here exactly myself. Another thing I wanted to mention to you is today, the Common Sense Conservative, and I wish I could find his stuff, but he had to take it down off YouTube. There was a rally up in Olympia, Washington today. Small rally. Again, once again, small rally. But around 1 o'clock, 1.30, probably about 5,000 motorcycles came through on the rally, blocking streets, going, I believe, down the wrong way on streets on the opposite side of the street. It was amazing. I was excited watching. I'm like, oh, I should have went. I was planning on going. Me and Mr. Bill were talking about going, but I was kind of a fair weather patriot today, so I didn't go because it was raining. It was exciting to watch. It was exciting to see about 5,000. I'm saying 5,000. There was at least, and probably more, at least 1,000 motorcycles. I want to say probably. It took about a half hour or more for these motorcycles to pass the Common Sense Conservative who was streaming it. Seriously. And I'm talking about four or five deep per row. It was cool to see. Man, if that could happen more. Okay, I'm going to step away for a minute, you guys. I'll look for the Common Sense Conservative, that link, and maybe try to show that if I can somehow during this. But real quick, LJ on YouTube, let me give you a quick recap, which I thought I did. But if you're just tuning in. So from my understanding, this group that's facing the police that the camera is looking at, it's called Patriot Front. From my understanding, they marched to the Capitol today in Washington, D.C. and marched back to Virginia. So they crossed the bridge that separates D.C. or Maryland and Virginia. Marched back, and that's where they're at right now. Kind of looks like they might be by Reagan Airport someplace. I'm not sure, but I'm looking at that sign. And that's really all I know. And actually, they've been standing there. This is half of the group, part of the group, and they've been standing in this position for the past hour and a half waiting for other people to come back to pick them up, which they've been transported by U-Haul. So that's what I know. And I've just pointed out how much in order they are. I completely admire that. Like just the discipline, which they do train. I don't know what they exactly train for, but they do train. So am I still talking low? Yeah, it is. I don't know why it's low when I'm talking. I have no clue. I have it turned up, but it don't seem like it's really doing much when I do turn it up for whatever reason. So I'm going to have to go into settings and see. Let me see something real quick. How's that? Is that better? Yeah, that's better. I had no clue that it's that low. So hopefully that's better. I'll turn the stream up, though. I'm going to step away for a few minutes, you guys. I'll be back, okay? I'll turn the stream up. Partly why the stream is low, real quick. Partly why the stream is low, because news to share, they don't talk that much. They more just film and do stuff. And there's not a lot of action going on. There's not, this group isn't arguing with the police. Police aren't talking back. There's not opposing groups there. So there's not, they're just standing there. Like military does. They're just standing. So that's why you don't hear a lot of stuff going on except traffic. So the people who are watching to kind of clarify what you're seeing, the police kind of built a wall of cars around the remaining Patriot Front guys. Before it was kind of a wider perimeter of guys, and now there's basically a three-sided wall of vehicles around the Patriot Front people. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's either Leo or you. Or what? Or you. Yeah. Maybe this is it. That also could be your shot. Thank you. I was sitting at home, and we were debating going to shoot the Christmas tree, the Capitol tree. Oh, yeah. You called up the people that were there. I saw the tree was lit up when I went to film Easter. I don't think they lit it Wednesday. They started at the Lincoln Memorial, and then I got in an Uber, and I heard they're going to the Lincoln Memorial, and I see that they're walking down the mall. So I changed the destination to the Washington Monument, and I saw that they went by that, and I changed the destination again. So I texted Matt. I Ubered my way. I freaked out. I texted Matt. He jumped in a Uber. He was following me. He was following me. He didn't want to make it. He was like, why do you want to cap this until it's Uber time? I went to that Capitol. I didn't want to text him. He had their head back to Lincoln. I said, look, you were talking about the Capitol. I mean, it's so funny. I can't help but have this whole thing. It's like, the whole thing is that they show up places, and then it'll be a really fast, so they're kind of like, okay, we're going to the Capitol. They don't want us to go to the Capitol. They don't want us to go to the Capitol. They don't want people to know the whole situation by coming in and out really quickly. It's shocking to me that the process looks so fast. That we're staying. I've been filming them now for three and a half hours. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I. That was a single file. That was definitely solidly. It's kind of like a work of art. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Everyone. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. How are you doing? Oh, how long has it been since that? That's a. Yes. Yeah. You have a note of when the last one that single is the last. The last you haul was eight. Was eight. It's it's almost nine. Right. So. And before it was at Lex. Yeah, what I'm trying to think is like, are they taking it around? They told me they told me that they are not helping them. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I think they're not going to help us. Yeah. They are going to help. No, that makes sense. I get that. I mean. Press here. Almost. Yeah. Your name. Right. Right. Okay. Yeah. I don't see a single. Again, their, their whole thing is showing up spontaneously. So that there's no reporters like they don't want. I'm going to have to go back and look at it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. But do you know if they plan to come back tomorrow? Do you know? No idea. Okay, so they're just going to be here today sporadically? It's always flash rallies. And when they did this in February, my understanding is that they had some kind of, like this was infiltrated, like anti-flip people were like posting and stuff. Like, when they did this in February of last year, they had like some kind of a campground somewhere in Virginia. So like they were doing like a weekend, like, like private camp thing. And then this was their like public field trip of that weekend. So like they had people together for, you know, some number of days. And then spent one of those days running around. It would really surprise me if they came back tomorrow because like the whole thing is showing up to places by surprise. Like people would, people would be more aware, more prepared, whatever. Okay. Wait. Okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry. It wouldn't surprise me if they're watching from earlier in like an hour. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What happened? Okay. Okay. Were there more reporters here earlier? Yeah. Yeah, there were. How many? A lot? Not a lot more, but more than three. I feel like at this height, maybe a dozen. And then there was a few like weird streamers. Like there was a guy wearing an American first mask who was like yelling about freedom of the press. Those are broy bros, right? Those are part of the white nationalist movement. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you recognize the particular guy? Yeah, the guy who was just over here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a broy bro. Okay. I think we're a little bit behind on the stream that I'm showing you guys. He is news to share. He's getting ready to come on and say something. I've been watching his stuff, and I think we're a little bit behind a couple minutes. So he's going to come on here in just a second and give you guys an update. And then after he gives the update, I'm going to just come on to me and then get forward, at least catch up to his stuff. Probably about two or three minutes behind his, so I need to check that out. So since he's talking right now, I'm going to let you guys hear that. I'll just do another recap for the people who are watching and might not know what's going on here. So this group, Patriot Front, had maybe 150 people marching kind of around Washington, D.C. earlier. And they marched across the bridge here from the Lincoln Memorial over to the Virginia side here, basically Arlington National Cemetery. And when they got here, they had two giant U-Hauls that they basically stuffed half their members into these two U-Hauls, and then those two U-Hauls drove away. And the rest of their people were basically standing here with a line of shields, and then police in front of that protecting those guys. About maybe an hour and 15 minutes later or so, one U-Haul came back. Assuming it's one of those two original U-Hauls, but one U-Haul came and picked up another maybe half of the remaining people. So roughly one-fourth of the original group, I guess, seems to still be standing here about three hours later, two and a half hours since they got here. This livestream's been going on for three hours and 45 minutes, and I arrived late. They didn't announce this event. Basically, I saw on Twitter that it was happening when I got an Uber over to it. So at this point, these guys have been standing here kind of stranded, and the police confirmed that they're not going to pick them up. They're not going to give them a ride. So the police are basically parked in a circle around those remaining guys. I count maybe about 30 of them, but it could be a little more. So the police are basically parked in a circle around them. Before the bridge outgoing from DC was blocked off and this road here was blocked off, they reopened it to traffic after parking these police cars around the people. So basically, they're sitting in their own little police car zone, and it appears that they're just waiting, presumably, on one of these U-Hauls to come and pick them up again. The reason that I want to cover this to the end, until they leave, is I want to be able to confirm that they've actually gone and that they actually go via U-Haul. For example, although it sounds like the police are not going to do this, I would certainly want to document it if ultimately the police escorted them away, provided them transportation. And that seems not to be the case here. So we will see what ends up happening, but that's why I'm still live. I should note that now that I'm at 3 hours and 45 minutes, Facebook in particular cuts off live streams at 4 hours. So in 15 minutes, what I'm probably going to do is shut down the live stream, but I'll stay out here so that I can record their final exit whenever that does happen. So I'll be live for another 15 minutes, but I'll be on site until they leave. All right, so there you guys go. I want to pot it down, and I want to flip over to just me, and then bring it back in, just so that I can skip up ahead to see what's going on. It looks like he may have ended it. Not sure. No, it's still playing. Okay, so I'll flip back over to it right now. There we go. So this is real time. There we go. So this is real time right now. So they're still standing there. So in case you guys are just tuning in, let me try to give you a little recap from what I do know. In front of those police officers—I keep going over here and all that—in front of those police officers, there's a group right up there. Yeah, up there. The group is called Patriot Front. From my understanding, probably now, I'd say, two and a half, three hours ago, they marched to the Capitol, and then they marched back. This is now officially in Virginia. You can see the sign right there, Reagan National Airport, Mount Vernon. They are officially in Virginia, and I guess they're waiting on U-Hauls. From my understanding, from what News2Share was explaining, U-Hauls dropped them off, and now U-Hauls are picking them up. The thing about Patriot Front—and if you go back to some of the footage earlier from the live stream—they are very trained and disciplined, just like the street preachers. Street preachers, especially the ones with Ruben and the ones I particularly preach with myself, the ones who are considered hateful, considered a terrorist group, considered a hate group, just probably like all the rest of the Patriot groups out there who are considered hate groups and bigots and Nazis and XYZ. The street preachers are labeled the same thing from the SPLC, that whole whatever, Nazi, communist, law group, whatever they are. And the thing about Patriot Front, they're very disciplined. They're very organized. They wear the same stuff. They have the same shields. They're kind of unidentified, because you can't go along and pick, oh, well, that's so-and-so, that's so-and-so, because they're matching. They're in uniform. They're in sync, kind of like how Antipa is, kind of like what I've been saying that a lot of Patriots should have been doing. Everybody's always worried about being doxxed and figured out, yet everybody goes out there, and you can easily be identified, because no one matches. Most of the time, a lot of the Patriot groups are out of order. They're not structured. They're not disciplined. They're not that trained in comparison to what I've seen at Patriot Front. And Patriot Front's just waiting there. They've been in this position just facing these police officers for about an hour and a half. And a lot of people are saying, well, there's no sound. Well, there's not a confrontation going on. And even if there was a confrontation going on, from what I have seen of Patriot Front, they would not be saying words back. From what I've seen of Patriot Front, they stand there and let the insults go. They're very trained. They're patient. There's not a lot of combative-type words being said to if there is opposing group. Okay, folks. So at about four minutes now until this live stream will have been running for four hours straight, which I believe means that Facebook would take it down. So in order to prevent that, I want to stop, and I want to give it a little bit of a gap of a few minutes so that it doesn't get taken down or whatever. But I'm going to stay out here recording. I will make sure that I do capture the end of this. If you know my work, you know I do try to capture things sort of beginning to end, make sure that the context of everything is provided, all that kind of stuff. So I do plan to stay out here to the end and make sure I can report back on whether the Patriot Front people are escorted away or ultimately if their U-Haul returns and picks them up. But again, just as a quick final review of what happened, my understanding is that they had a march that began basically here and that they marched into Washington, D.C., went to the Lincoln Memorial, and then marched all across the National Mall, past the Washington Monument to the Capitol. They gave speeches at the Capitol, and that was basically where I arrived. I heard that they were at the Lincoln Memorial and then got in an Uber and kept changing the destinations to sort of follow where I was finding out that they were. I ended up at the Capitol, which is where I began this live stream, filming them as they gave speeches there, and then returned. They started returning this way. They marched again down the Mall, got to the Lincoln Memorial, came across this bridge, showed up here, and then there were two U-Hauls parked here. They loaded up about half their guys into those two U-Hauls, which then drove away, and it wasn't until like an hour and 15 minutes later or so that one of those U-Hauls, presumably one of them, showed up. Now that I say it, there is one showing up right behind me. It looks like it's about to happen right now that it's about to pick them up. I will show that, and then the live stream's going to end. Thank God. It better be that. I'm getting so cold. I really want this to be over. I'm going to go around the corner. So you just heard what he said. From his understanding, you can go four hours on Facebook. I believe you can go eight. So I'm trying to get a hold of some people to let him know that it can be eight hours. I did myself. I did get a hold of a news to share. Actually, unfortunately, because it's about to be one minute to the four hour mark, which I think would cause Facebook to take down the live stream. I'm going to take down the live feed, but I see the U-Haul, which I'm 90% sure is going to be the one picking them up. So I will record that. I will have out the HD footage later tonight. Like, share, subscribe, all that good stuff. I'm ending the stream right here. Okay, so he didn't get the message in time. I'll give him a call later. In case you guys are wondering, that's news to share. That's who that is. So, maybe I can go back and see if he caught up to the marches. He said he caught up to them, like around the National Monument. It might take a few minutes to get, you know, to catch up, because that's just how YouTube is. You can't go back. Okay, here they are. By the way, let me throw this in here real quick. You guys saw me this past week back in D.C. on Wednesday for the Roe vs. Wade, the opening day. While I was there, you know, fellow brethren of mine that I know personally for quite a while, they were there street preaching. Probably about 30 street preachers. They had the banners up, and I know some of you guys are like, Oh, that's the wrong way to do it. You know, that's not the loving way. Well, you know, they're in your face, they're truthful, and they are very loving. I'm one of them myself. They're very loving. I know firsthand, and many of you guys do too, as well. Mama Bear and Reverend Gunn and other people who do follow me. However, what I'm trying to say and get to, at 7 p.m., so in about 35 minutes, on Reuben Israel, on his YouTube channel, if you guys are following him, there's going to be a premiere of the highlights of this past week while they were in D.C. preaching at different places. So, that's coming on in about 35 minutes at the top of the hour on Reuben Israel. His YouTube channel. So, if you guys want to see highlights of them street preaching, and again, this is bold, in-your-face, offensive street preaching at times, you know, at times when it needs to be. And it is warning people about the damnation of hell, because we, as people who are loving, if we actually care about people's souls, we need to let them know that without Jesus Christ, the separation of Jesus Christ, they are destined for the lake of fire. That's just the truth of it, like it or not. And so, that stuff does need to be shared. It needs to be expressed, and especially in environments like there was in D.C. when you have people out there who enjoy the murdering and killing of innocent children. There's going to be a harsh message. So, again, if you guys want to see highlights from the past week when street preachers were in D.C., it's going to be on Reuben Israel's YouTube channel. All you got to do is type in Reuben Israel, and I'm sure it'll pop straight up. That's at the top of the hour. So, let's go back to seeing what these guys were doing earlier this evening, as far as marching and what was taking place. Victory. Push out a little bit for the bikes, gentlemen and ladies. That's patriot front walking. ASG, thank you for the $5 Super Chat. Appreciate that. Yeah, Mr. Nice Guy, Reuben Israel on YouTube. I don't know what the march was about. They don't really talk patriot front, but look at them. They're in order. They're structured. Same attire, same gear. You don't see faces. I like it. I like it. Pretty deep. One thing about patriot front, they don't announce where they're going, what they're doing, when they're going to show up. It's like a flash mob type of thing. That's what it is. So, right there, I think that's Constitution Avenue, right along the National Mall. That's what it looks like. That's where they were marching earlier today, this evening. Probably, by the looks of it, it looks like it might have been around 5 p.m. Eastern time. Maybe 4.30ish. I like it, man. People start doing it. Man, there must be something in the Portland water regarding the patriots. I'm just saying, real talk. Even the day up in Olympia, there was about 5,000. I'm going to say 5,000. I'm trying to get the correct number. I haven't got a report yet. But there was about a half hour where there was nonstop motorcycles going down by the Capitol in Olympia, Washington today. For a half hour, the Common Sense Conservative on YouTube was streaming it. Just cycles, motorcycles, the streets were blocked off. They had the streets blocked off. They were driving down the wrong way. It was awesome. It was awesome. There's just something about the patriot groups here that's just like, why can't it get together? You're not seeing patriot front out there drinking, smoking, hanging around. They are serious. These cats are serious. No one knew this was going on because they don't really announce stuff. They just start marching. Police had to come in and figure it all out. And then when they're leaving, they're standing facing the police. They're not moving around. They're not laughing. They're not shaking hands. They're not eating. They're not talking. They're not arguing back with police. They're quiet. They're standing still in military position, holding the line. Yeah. Can someone prove Bill Evans? They are as bad as KKK. Can you prove that? Can you prove it? I don't want no liberal left-leaning magazine that calls myself Nazi or a bigot. That don't count. Give me something that's true because the left says I'm a bigot and racist and XYZ. So give me something true that proves that they are like KKK. I've heard rumors. I actually have. I've heard rumors. I've heard rumors about myself that I'm Nazi as well. So that's why I'm saying that. Let me put the two guys this way. Within the past year, I've been around some patriot front. Just saying one time. Reclaim America. Fight liberty, victory! So I just posted the link for the YouTube Ruben Israel premiere that will be happening in about 25 minutes now. So I just posted it there. You guys can check it out. This was in Washington, D.C. today. No one knew about it. Patriot Front is a group. They showed up. And there's been rumors about Patriot Front because of where it started and things like that. And that it's basically a modern-day KKK. And even if that's the case, let's just say even if that is the case that they are KKK or modern-day KKK, they have the right to do that. And from what I'm seeing, it's way more peaceful than Antifa. And like I said, I think I was around Patriot Front maybe one time this year. And there was no insults spewed at me in comparison to Antifa and the left. So to me, I'm like, even if they are, I'm like, I still can deal with that. Just being honest. Just, you know, there's many rumors out there that Patriot Front is like a modern-day KKK. I don't personally believe it myself. People are starting to yell. They're about to storm the Capitol, dude. They won't talk to nobody. They won't argue with people. Are they storming the Capitol? See? This is awesome. This, whatever they were up to, this is awesome. And I wouldn't be surprised if something like this happens on January 6th. I would not be surprised. Come on. I wish I would have known. Do you notice the drums as well? Wait, someone said the Oath Keepers are all white supremacists. Oh my, you guys are idiots. There's David's tent right there. I don't even know where I was going. That threw me off. The drums. Do you hear the drums? You hear how even, in sync, and organized the drum is? It's not a bunch of noise, not a bunch of chanting, not a bunch of chaos, and a bunch of makeshift, homemade pots and pans to make it sound like people are out there jamming and having a good time. It's very, like, yo, it's very missional. Like, that's what it is. Hi, to the folks who are watching, I don't think I've spoken yet on this livestream, so I'm just going to give a quick little explanation. I heard about this as apparently they were crossing from Arlington into D.C., which puts them basically at the Lincoln Memorial. My understanding is that they then march basically across the entire National Mall, the way that we're essentially, you know, like... Sorry, this was unexpected. They're now, they're moving basically in the reverse route of what I understand is the way that they came in. They're marching along the National Mall, sort of back toward the Lincoln Memorial, although they just took a turn, which I don't really understand, southbound. So, we'll see. But just for context, this is a group led by a guy named Thomas Rousseau, who I actually interviewed at Charlottesville, and he referred to himself as a fascist. He identifies as a fascist. So this is not, you know, a pro-Trump group. This isn't a sort of patriot group in the traditional way. They use American flag type imagery, but they have the, you know, the fascists on the flag. Like, they are about fascists, led by, you know, someone who self-identifies as a fascist. So, you know, they use a lot of kind of like language that's viewed as patriotic and so forth. But basically their message is explicitly white nationalist. Anyhow, they are walking. Now they kind of just crossed the National Mall. So they're on the south side of the National Mall, heading, I guess, westbound toward the Washington Monument, and presumably then all the way back to the Lincoln Memorial, where I assume they'll turn back into Virginia. But I mean, I could certainly be wrong. I found out about this from Twitter. Actually, it was anti-fascist accounts that posted that they were entering D.C. And so by the time I arrived here, they were already at the Capitol. So my understanding is that basically they've been in D.C. for as much as like a half hour or an hour by the time that I actually arrived and began this live stream. My understanding is that they unleashed some, like, you know, smoke bombs or something like that from some videos that I saw on Twitter. But I'm—and there's been a very large police escort for them the whole way through. It's not clear to me whether they have a permit or whether they pre-planned the police escort. But that's what's basically going on. Lots of police surrounding them. There's been a handful of both bystanders yelling at them as well as organized activists, but only a few. So we'll see what happens. Okay, so what I've been doing is playing just the live stream that ended a little bit ago of, excuse me, News to Share, playing their stuff, News to Share. This is their live stream from earlier. They just cut it about 10 minutes ago when Facebook had to end their feed. So if you're watching this right now, this is from earlier today, this evening in Washington, D.C., Patriot Front just started marching. No one knew. It was unexpected. As you heard News to Share, as he said there, he spoke to this person, the leader of this maybe chapter or organization. It might be a chapter in D.C. I don't know exactly. Said that they self-identified as—or he said white nationalists. I don't know. I personally haven't spoke to them. And, again, white nationalists, to me, in my opinion, personally, is a trigger word. And I don't have no problem with the word or people with white nationalists. For me, I had to go a little bit further into talking to those people to get a better understanding of things and their viewpoints on stuff. But just the whole white nationalist thing is a trigger word. It don't bother me personally. Like I said, because there are different levels, and people have their own views on white nationalism within their own self. For people who do believe in white nationalism. Are there some that are kind of—that are more racist and hold white people at a better, more superior? Yes, there are. Yes, there are. And that's just being honest. But also, to be honest, there are white nationalists who don't think that, hey, we're white people and that we are superior. So, like I said, I have to personally talk to someone who is a white nationalist before I personally can say, oh, yeah, they're racist. So, hold on. I just got a— Okay, Muse2Share just texted me. So, they didn't know it ended at eight or four hours. So, yeah. Anyway, I'll—yeah, I'll get back to him in just a moment. I'm going to get off here, and I'm going to get ready to watch Ruben Israel's premiere that takes place in about 17 minutes on YouTube under Ruben Israel YouTube channel. Did I say Facebook at first? Okay, it's under Ruben Israel YouTube channel. So, go over there. I did post a link earlier up above. Maybe I could pin it. I don't know if I can pin it from here. Anyway, I might not be able to pin it. I'm not sure if I can pin it. Let me say, InnerTiaAir, is that right? Thank you for the super chat. God bless you. The narrative, both sides is controlled by the same group. You play, you lose. War is mass ritual sacrifice. War is mass ritual sacrifice. All right. Major Woody, thank you for the super chat. Says, thanks for streaming tonight, guys. FJB. Let's go, Brandon, in other words. Yeah, so. Cool, cool, cool. So, I'm going to get off you guys. Again, that was news to share, okay? So, if you guys aren't following news to share, go follow that on YouTube. That's who caught this footage. That's who caught the footage for this. Let me get to the, I'll post it one more time, the link for the Reuben Israel. And that was from this past week. Let me see if I can get the. Let me get the. This is it right here, okay. Hopefully I can copy it. It's not, I don't want to copy. It's not letting me copy, why? It's not letting me copy. It's trying to copy it in here. So, I got to write the whole thing out. So, let me write the whole thing out. So, you guys can have it again. And I'm going to get off and get ready to watch it. I think this is it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Let me do it this way. Yeah, I'll do it this way. Let me see if that works. That should work. All right, you guys, let me get out of here. I want to get off. Like I said, get ready to watch this. I just put the link in there. My wife did it on Facebook. So, I just put it on all platforms right there. Hopefully, that will work. All right, you guys. I don't have no outro because I think we, this was just spontaneous. Again, thank you all for the super chat. I'm going to get out of here. God bless you guys. I will see you next time. Later, later, later. God bless."

Oh, my God. So someone who was yelling at them, I'm not sure if it was a bystander or an actual activist, but kind of ran by them and yelled, look who likes masks now. And I just want to point out about that, that they did this basically the same stunt in February 2020. And they also wore masks. And of course, that was before COVID. Were you here on January 6? I'm sorry? I said, were you here on January 6? Yeah, ProPublica Newsroom chair. Oh, nice. On the land media, small media company out in Alaska. Oh, cool. Yeah.

399,CNN_Video_shows_masked_White_nationalist_group_marching_at_Lincoln_Memorial-1080p-.mp4," A chilling sight in the nation's capital, a white nationalist group known as the Patriot Front descended on the National Mall over the weekend. Its members wore masks, some carried plastic shields, and according to their banner, they were marching, as they put it, to reclaim America. Joining me now, early start anchor and CNN correspondent Laura Jarrett, back with the CNN senior political analyst John Avalon. Look, we can agree that one is too many, right? To see anyone marching a white supremacist to the Lincoln Memorial is a sight that none of us ever wants to see. There's something almost too on the nose about having a bunch of guys dressed up like they're ready to go to war, dressed up with battle armor and shields, because in their minds, the Civil War never ended, right? And what they're chanting is always so telling, reclaim America. When was America ever taken? And who was it taken from and by whom? Well, they feel like it's been taken from white folks. But since when are brown and black people ahead, right? So since when are white men still not on top? We're applying logic to their anxiety. My point is to say there's something so remarkable about having self-avowed white nationalists, white supremacists, marching on a memorial for somebody who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It just sort of exemplifies the country's ongoing struggle with racism. Yeah. And look, the fact that we're seeing an acceleration in the wake of Charlottesville, that these are young folks and they're masking and they're carrying shields and battle armor, which of course is a sign of their own weakness. These are weak, anxious people trying to find definition and strength in this kind of militaristic white nationalist nonsense. The reason it's more than just a bunch of clowns trying to march on the Lincoln Memorial is the ADL found that this particular group, Patriot Front, was responsible for 80% of the white supremacist propaganda found on campus and elsewhere in 2020. So, and it's a young person's movement. This isn't just a bunch of old cranks waving their fist at the sky about how the country is changing. The leader is 23 years old. I will tell you, they were wearing masks. One of the things I felt that was most chilling about Charlottesville was people walking around unmasking. Here I am. I have no shame over this. We are free to express ourselves because that's where we think we are in this country right now. They didn't want their identities known. Yeah. Who also wore masks and face coverings. I mean, I don't want to think we want to take too much comfort from that. I'm not, but I'm saying there's a difference here. And I don't know whether it's not that they think that the attitude in the country is different towards the message that they're delivering or not. I just, you know, it is notable. But the question is really what has changed since Charlottesville, right? I mean, that's 2017. The FBI director, to your point, the idea that we dismiss this as sort of fringe actors, the FBI director, right? Chris Wray has told us that the number one threat to this country, domestic terrorism wise, is white supremacy. He has said that this is on par with ISIS. And the question is, since Charlottesville, what have we done? What has the government done to address this? There has been legal accountability and culpability, as we saw, I mean, in a verdict, you know, in Charlottesville to the tune of $26 million. That may be why they were masked, by the way. It may very well be. And none of that changes the fact that these folks are cowards. Everyone who runs to find security in a blood and soil movement is because they are weak and they're trying to pretend they're strong. But we also shouldn't underestimate the historical resonance of this, which is why Laura is saying it. And the fact that this is a current issue in our country that we need to confront when they come masked and carrying battle shields to the Lincoln Memorial. You know, pay attention, folks, because this is a problem that we need to confront. This virus of hate and white supremacy and white nationalism in our country is not done yet. The only good thing is this one didn't turn violent, but the next one could. And that's always the concern. Laura Chair, John Avalon, thank you very much."

407,Cross_Media-11.mov," I'm going to do a knee to elbow. So again, I'm going to cover up here. I'm going to pick a side. I'm going to go to my left side. I'm going to turn on my side. I dig my elbow up underneath his knee here. And then I'm going to put my knee underneath his foot here. I'm going to sneak up underneath. Now, once I'm here, I'm going to turn to my other side quickly. Here, create some distance, come out, and get guard. I don't have to close up. I can just get him right here. This is much better than being mounted. You can do that one more time. So again, he's got mount. I'm going to cover up. I'm going to pick a side to go to. Fall flat. So I'm going to go, I'm going to turn on my side. I'm going to scoop underneath and bring my knee to my elbow at the same time. Here, my knee goes underneath his foot, scooping. Knee comes to elbow, underneath here. Once I've cleared this leg, I'm going to immediately flip to the other side, turn, and create some distance so I can get this leg out here. So once I'm here, I'm out of mount. That's all I'm concerned with. From here, I can fight with my hooks underneath. I don't care. It doesn't bother me. So again, once I've come here, boom, I've cleared this leg this way. Now, I've immediately got to turn to my other hip, get on my other side. I'm on my left side now, so I've got to get to my right side. I'm going to go to my left side, from here. I'm going to brace on his knee here, so I can get my hips out. And now... So at that point, you kind of strip escape. Yeah, you're stripping out here, get my hips out, so I can just come and make some space, recover some sort of guard. And from here, we're good. I can up kick, do whatever. Just not be confident."
408,Cross_Media-12.mov," I'm going to go to my left, I'll actually bring my right foot up, here, scoop, knee to elbow, I want my knee, or my elbow to come underneath his knee, my knees are in a split, scoop, here, once I've got my knee to my elbow I switch hips, here, brace, I'm going to strip out, get my knee out, and recover our guard."
409,Cross_Media-13.mov," Once you get some sort of half bar, we switch to the other side. There you go. Switch to the other side. There you go. Get your hips out. There you go. There you go. Flip the other hip. There you go. Push out. There you go. My legs are down like this. There you go. I'm trying to get my knee up underneath that little spot here and go in here. Once I'm here, go in."
410,Cross_Media-14.mov," Get this hand. Try to grab the wrist. Grab the wrist. There you go. Like a rear naked. Yeah. Back your head in. Squeeze. See if you can get the tap. You got my arm too high. My arm's on my face instead of my neck. So you want it underneath his chin ideally. Like that. How am I supposed to get his arm across that way? So if you've got your arms up here blocking. I'm just going to go in like this. Yeah. Once he's getting trapped behind there. I'm just going to dig my arm. I'm just showing you a position. More than likely. Or you can use this arm to grab my wrist like a monkey hole. And push it down. And then use your body. And then once I got there. You want to be up underneath his arm. There you go. His elbow's got to be up top. Step off to this side. There you go. Pull back. Let him squeeze. Now. I want you to come across. Is that like. You've got the mechanics good. So come off now. Hold the position. All your legs come over here. So step over with this leg. There you go. Now sit down on your butt. There you go. Keep rocking. Pull his head back. Keep going. Squeeze in here. Maintain this. It's a harder technique. I guess the bigger guy. But typically what's going to happen is. You're not just going to set this up. What's going to be happening is. We're here. We're grappling. And I'm already got this position. Maintain some pressure. Come across like this. Now once I'm here. Now I'll get the position. Even here. His arm is across his face. I'm not underneath his chin. I can still finish. Because if anything. I'm blocking off his nose and his mouth. So squeeze here again. If I don't have this. This is still. This technique right here. Just holding this position. Your buddy can also come kick him in the face. Very easily right there. I don't weigh nearly as much as Cross. Even a light guy. If he does this right. I'm rocking onto his ribs. This sucks. This is a shitty position. Couple that with the fact that his arm is across here. And you're squeezing. It's a good technique. When you guys start off. Go ahead and start off with the hand underneath here. Just work. Push the arm across. Then grab. Squeeze first. If I can't get that. Then I come across. Again, I'm sitting through. Until I get that tap."
411,Cross_Media-15.mov, Let's just start out with the arm like this. This is how it's going to go. Most of the guys will try to create this to the same. You're going to hop behind. Push it back and go downstairs. Go down the stairs. Good. You want to bring this arm under. There you go. You want to add a curve. Start to squeeze against the mat. You guys want to start with one arm.
412,Cross_Media-2.mov," He learned lessons. Some the easy way, some the hard way. Alright. Come on Cole, you got this. Oh, right on the gear. No, this flies! He'll not move onto the concrete. Just remember he's a daily man. Oh shoot. Sorry. Let's try that again. It's a new one right there. Alright. I knew what to do with his arms. You're going to trap the right side here. Roll. Alright. I'll show you what to do. Alright. Best to learn through experience."

You've got somebody in there naked. You should have your fingers next to your fishing. Over his shoulder. Good job.
416,Cross_Media-5.mov," I was like, hold on! So he's moving for the choke. So, you fucked up. You crossed your ankles. So when he does this, the foot that's on top, I'm going to take my opposite leg, go over here, triangle, and extend my hips, until I get the tap. Right there. Don't ever cross your feet."

419,Dana_Milbank_Reporters_Should_Be_Partisan_When_It_Comes_To_Democracy.mp4," Good evening, everyone. We begin the readout tonight with some scenes from Washington, D.C. this weekend. You're looking at a group of more than 100 white supremacists called the Patriot Front who marched around outside the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday night. Their goal, they say, is to reclaim America on behalf of their white ancestors. And according to the Anti-Defamation League, they openly define themselves as fascists. Now, if they seem familiar, that's because they were among the extremist groups at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, though they changed their name after one of their members murdered Heather Heyer with his car. Of course, their extremist views and ridiculous plastic shields earned them lots and lots of mockery this weekend, especially when several were awkwardly left stranded at the Arlington Memorial Bridge because their U-call wasn't large enough to carry them all home. Indeed, they look, OK, really stupid and it's easy to laugh at them. But to do so would be to underestimate them and the millions like them whose radical ideas are on the ascent in this country. Let's not forget the many who laughed at Donald Trump back in 2016 and even after he was elected. Thanks to four years of Trump, this country is now a backsliding democracy, according to an international think tank. And that is no joke. The truth is, this country doesn't have a great track record of recognizing authoritarians for what they are, at least not until it's too late. According to Smithsonian magazine, Benito Mussolini was a darling of the American press and American papers credited Italian fascism with saving Italy from the far left and revitalizing its economy. Similarly, Adolf Hitler was dismissed as a joke, a nonsensical screecher of wild words, according to Newsweek at the time. American press outlets predicted Hitler would be outplayed by more traditional politicians or would become more moderate. In other words, they got it wrong, badly wrong. Now fast forward to the current day and we're seeing a similar pattern emerge when it comes to the threat of Trump's big lie. As Barton Gelman warns in The Atlantic, state Republican operatives have been building an apparatus of election theft under our very noses. He notes that if the plot succeeds, the ballots cast by American voters will not decide the presidency in 2024. Thousands of votes will be thrown away or millions to produce the required effect. The winner will be declared the loser. The loser will be certified president elect. That would be the end of democracy as we know it. This American experiment with multiracial democracy, well, that will be over. And yet for much of the media in this country, it's been business as usual, despite that looming threat. As columnist Dana Milbank writes in The Washington Post, too many journalists are caught in a mindless neutrality between democracy and its saboteurs between fact and fiction. It's time to take a stand. For his column, Milbank actually hired a data analytics company to measure and compare media sentiment toward President Biden and toward Donald Trump. He found that Biden's press for the last four months has been as bad as and for a time even worse than the coverage that Trump received for the same four months of 2020. Not only that, but Trump got roughly twice as much coverage in 2020 as Biden has received in all of 2021 so far. Milbank notes that the country is in an existential struggle between self-governance and an authoritarian alternative. And we in the news media collectively have given equal, if not slightly more favorable treatment to the authoritarians. Dana Milbank joins me along with Jason Johnson, professor of journalism and politics at Morgan State University and host of the Slate podcast Award with Jason Johnson, along with Nancy McLean, historian and author of Democracy in Chains, the deep history of the radical rights stealth plan for America. Dana, I am going to start with you because I noticed that the response to many media beltway media people to your piece was to fight with you about being mean to their particular media entity. Right. You had people from Politico yelling at you on Twitter saying you said mean things about Politico. And it's like, that's not the point. And I feel like you kept trying to make the point that this isn't about, you know, saying mean things about one media outlet's coverage. It's literally the overall impact of their coverage. You wrote Biden is attempting to salvage democratic norms. The people opposing him are using fascist tools of deception and voter disenfranchisement. Neutrality in the struggle is not a virtue. I hear heared you and high five you on Twitter. I just want to let you go. Talk about what you've seen from the inside of what this media is doing, in your view, that's helping authoritarianism thrive. Yeah, Joy, I and I certainly didn't mean to suggest that it's a problem of one outlet or another or this one's better than that. Sure, some are better than others, but that's not the point. This is I mean, think about it. Comparing the form of last four months to the four months of 2020, when Donald Trump was threatening to not honor the results of a free and fair election and then ultimately didn't honor the results of a free and fair election. He was embracing the Proud Boys, white supremacists. He was embracing QAnon. I mean, he was sabotaging the post office. So this is and at that period of time, he got similar to even more favorable coverage than Biden is getting today. So I think that's astonishing. And look, people in my business, I and I support this notion. We like conflict. We're combative. We like to hold the powerful to account. But we're in a whole different game here. It's not Democrats against Republicans. It's small d Democrats against authoritarians. And as you note at the beginning, in many ways, we're losing the struggle. So I agree with reporters not being partisan, but we should be partisan when it comes to democracy. We should be partisan when it comes to the facts. And I think that's where I think we need to take a stand. Right. And, you know, Jason, you know, I've long said that the media is only real bias, at least the mainstream media is toward change and conflict. Right. Donald Trump was entertaining for a lot of Beltway journalists. He was also open. He gave lots of leaks. His administration gave you lots of data and lots of sort of conflict driven, you know, content. He was a content creator. And so there there was a you know, whereas when I remember when Barack Obama was in, the media generally disliked the Obama administration, even though they were not doing anything dangerous. He couldn't even wear a tan suit. The media would go ballistic and go nuts over him because he wasn't accessible, because he was seen as cold and not really accessible. There was no access. My challenge here and this goes all the way back to the way the media operate in the 20s with Mussolini is that the media underplays the danger when a political party is out of step with democratic norms and they overstate the horror when a Democrat generally or somebody who's more of a normal politician does anything that makes them annoyed, right? Anything that irritates sort of elite journalists. I'm worried that that tendency is always going to help the Trumps of the world and always going to hurt the Bidens. And that's not good for our democracy. Joy, you're exactly. No, it's not. And Dana, you're underselling yourself. No, thank you. Thank you for being someone who actually said this. And quite frankly, there's a racialized element to this as well, that I'm happy that you're the individual who said this, because this is something that black journalists have been screaming about since Donald Trump got into office. When the man ran basically saying, I'm going to clear out this country of anybody who's not white and straight. It took three years for large numbers of media outlets. And I'll say the names, not everybody at these particular outlets, but The Hill did this and Politico did this and The New York Times did this. We've all talked about this for years. It took almost three years for most of the mainstream press to say, hey, this guy is an actual existential threat to democracy. And people who talked about it, especially journalists of color, were called alarmist or told they were being extreme. And then it literally took a man trying to overthrow an election and then send terrorists to try to overthrow the results of the election in January for a lot of folks to realize it. It is a problem. It is a danger. Is it entirely the fault of the media? No, it's not. But it is in part the fault. We don't hold each other accountable. And when people want to get angry at the messenger, instead of taking responsibility for the messages that they've been spewing, this is arguably one of the most important articles of journalism I have seen in a very long time. I'm so happy that we're bringing this to the fore because as we go into 2022 and a lot of the things that they've talked about in the Atlantic start to manifest themselves. When you see in Georgia and Oklahoma and different in Texas, where large swaths of votes are going to get thrown out the window. If we don't establish the language and dialogue necessary to point these dangers out, then we will have stolen elections and 2024 will already be done."
420,DrillingInstruction_2_3.mp4," So every command is on a four count. Okay, so it's always one, two, three, four, and you start, you always start on the left foot. You always start off mark time, free march. It's mark time, mark and forward march and. Mark time, mark. Column halt. Placing your left foot last as well. Yeah, again, it's going to be a four count. Mark time, mark and, and then left foot one. Alright? Mark time, mark. Left, left, left, right, right, left, left, left, right, left, left, left, right, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left. Mark time, mark. And then it's going to be a similar four counts up. Detail halt. And you end with this time with your left foot. Detail halt. And. When you hear mark time, don't use the gun and strike your left foot. You should be anticipating it. It's like mark time and then march is the executed order. Just always keep in mind that it's four count. So I'll clap and that way, we'll clap that way you guys can kind of play in your head. So just one more time before we start. Mark time, march. And so what we usually do is I usually like in my end on the last count, which is silent. You do kind of like and or so like in his head, he says step. So like mark time, march, step. All right, so let's try that. I'll show you one more time. This is what we're going to do. Mark time, mark. Detail halt. This is what it's going to look like. Mark time, mark. And then the command forward march. Again, it's a four count and then you start off on the left foot. So forward march and. You want to try and maintain the form of our group as much as we can. So when we are actually moving, everyone is going to look out of their peripheral vision to their right. Everyone here on the right side of the formation are the people keeping the real spacing in between them and the column in front of them. So how do we maintain that right? Everybody on this side. Except for you, you're in front. Put your right arm out like this. That is how far you should be from the column. With your fist closed just for good measure. We're going to mark time and then forward march and then always start on your left foot. Mark time, mark. Forward march. Left, left, left. Right turn. Forward march. Left, left, left. Left turn. Left turn, left turn. There we go. Very nice. Mark time, march. Left, left, left. Forward march. Left face. Turn, turn. Yeah. Left turn. There we go. Left, left. So when it comes to doing a facing movement, these are turns executed while standing still. Make sense? In other words, it looks like this. For a left face, it's going to be here, here. You pivot on your left toe and on your right. Wait, no. Your left heel and your right toe. So for a left face, it's going to look like this. It's a two count movement. Here, here. For a right face, it's going to be right face, one, two. We want to say the whole command before it's executed so we know exactly what we're doing. We had previously done it a different way, but we're implementing a new memo. It's a reform. Left face. Get in there, get in there. We'll keep working on it. Left face. Left face. We'll say step to advance. So your left shoulder should be pinned on the shield right here. Step, recover. Step with the left, recover with the right. Step with the left. Lock, step. Lock. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. We're going to begin marching and we're going to see some issues. Lock, step, lock. Lock, at which point you can stop until you're told to step. You don't have to keep marching. Mark time, march. Left, left, left, left. Forward, march. Lock, step, lock. Step. We want change. We want change. Move, move, move. Move, move, move. Move, move, move. Move, move, move. Move, move, move. There's just like a screaming lip tart or something. We might want to, or like in Antifa, let's say there's one Antifa, like I said, just sitting down right here. It's not going to be a brawl. The front row will present their shields and be intimidating and all that, but do you need to be really bracing the guy in front of you hard? No, because if there's a crowd gathering, a salience, a reptile. Hold, hold. I don't like you! What are you doing out there? Bring it in! Bring it in! I give up! Step, hold. Step, hold. I don't like you! You hurt my feelings! Step, hold. I will kill you! Step, hold. Blackout battle! On your mark. Cycle back. Cycle back. Excellent. Good spacing. Cycle back. Very nice, very nice. Cycle back. Doing good, guys. Keep that pace up. Back! Cycle back. Step, hold. Step, hold. Step, hold. Step, hold. Push it back! Step, hold. Step, hold."

441,drilling_draft1.mp4," 🎵 Ladies, lockstep, lock! There was a big disparity in time there. Now you guys look alright, sure you could get a little bit neater. That's alright, as long as we're presenting a unified wall of fucking steel, it doesn't matter, we're good. A hole like this, well you're better now, but before it was like that. That's exploitable, so let's say anywhere from like 3 to 4 inches is like an acceptable gap. Ready, alert, lockstep, lock! Hell yeah, much better. Now Jason, mind your gap there. It's alright if there's a little one, so long as you close it promptly. Lockstep, lock! Forward, march! So section, so there's three sections, rearguard, vanguard, and screens. So I would say section, which is referring to y'all, because in this case I am your section leader. Now imagine there's another 10 guys behind you with the same stuff. So if I say section, I'm referring to all of you, and if I say red team, blue team, etc. You get the idea. So in this case I am section, so I would say section, lock! Section, advance! Step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step! Forward march will be your first step, and then step, step, step, step, and we'll all fall into a rhythm. And just, once you fall into that rhythm, anticipate it and don't be like, step, step, step. It's, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop. Section, advance! Step, step, step, step, step, step, step! Step, step, step, step! A consistent, stationary wall of shields, and at no point should one of those stationary groups have to back up. Right? So instead of backing up, and then at a certain point, having to catch up like this, and then repeat, so depending on the speed of the column, what we do is, I'm the first row here, so I'm stationary, we make a call, and then what I would do, boom, make the call, boom, make the call. Back! Back! Back! Back! Back! Back! Cycle back! Watch the rear of that column. Cycle back! Cycle back! Cycle back! Good pace, boys, good pace, keep it up. Cycle back! I guess you guys should be cycling back at the speed I'm moving towards you. Space it out, space it out, space it out. Getting too close. Cycle back! Cycle back! Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up. The attacking team, the pigs, shows up. What y'all are going to do is, y'all may not have shields. You may be flags right now. What y'all are going to do is lock up. You're going to lock up. How are you going to do that with flags, buddy? If it's between getting arrested and dropping a flag. Maybe the flag just needs to go on the fucking ground. Yeah, so if it's in between that, so y'all are going to lock up, lock up, lock up and brace. If I try to grab him, I'm trying to pull him, and then I see that I'm isolated, now the pig is isolated, so I have to back off. So y'all will coordinate to get Adam, because your objective is to find and identify the instigator, pull him back, isolate him, and hog time. Y'all are defending, y'all are assailing. Okay? Alright. So, and remember, he doesn't have to be the guy in the center, right? You might want to reach for the guy on the side, right? You want to strategize a little bit, and you also want to communicate. Because, you know, those cops are going to be communicating with you. Yeah, they're going to hear what you're saying, but, you know, it's not a testimony. Go! Brace! Brace! Brace! Come on! Come on! Brace! Brace! Brace! No! No! No! No! No! No! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! We got him, we got him! Watch the rear! Watch the rear! Get him! Get him! Get him! This is good! We got him! Oh! Oh! No! No! No! We're on the other side! It's over! I'm going to put my left arm around his right arm, over my head, in his armpit. Bend at the knees, kind of use your elbows, and press off. So, I get real low, and if your partner's not hurt, he can kind of help you with this process. He's going to need to. He's going to put his left arm in the small of my back, like the tramp stamp. There you go, and you're just going to apply a little bit of pressure. Now I'm just going to stand up. All right, all his weight's off of me. It's basically on my right shoulder here, and I can just do a nice little jog. I'm going to get his arms in, bring his feet together like so. Let's see if I can get rid of this. Pick him up, step on his feet. Woo! Your right arm goes over your left arm, right? All right, and then me and Homie are going to interlock arms at our forearms. And then our casualty is just going to sit. King. King Patrick. You're a fat ass! Hail to the king! All right, so he has to be a bit conscious, because if he's not conscious, you don't want to do this, because his spine might not be aligned. But if he has ability to move his neck, but he stays like this. Oh, you get like a poncho in there or something. Yeah, something like that. Oh my god, Alex, are you okay? You take their shoulders around you, they go around your neck like you were doing before, and you can support their spine here. And then our canvas goes here, and you just lift one, two, three. Mark time, march! Forward, march! Mark time, march! Forward, march! So what I'm going to do is, when I call column left, I'm going to basically, like I'm marching, I'm marching, I'm marching, I'm going to stop and pick up my legs and just do this kind of thing. All right? Like I'm just turning the column on me. Mark time, march! Forward, march! Forward, march! Column left, march! Forward, march! Column left, march! Forward, march! Mark time, march! Slow it down, slow it down. Column halt! It should just be a smooth transition, but for right now, like, y'all see me mark time, and I think when y'all catch up to me, y'all want to mark time, so we're just going to do that for now. But when we start doing a real column left, I'm the only one that's marked time, right? And then when y'all catch up to me, then it should just be like a smooth transition back to mark time. So wouldn't it be like, you know, mark time, march, we're like this, and they say forward, march, shouldn't we, we should always start on the left? Yeah, it's left, it's always left. So if you say mark time, like, forward, march, and you're on the right, you should like take another step and then go right. Right, so if the guy calling the command fucks it up, wait for the next left foot to step off that. Alright, maybe I didn't illustrate that at the first time, that's my mistake, but if I'm calling a column left, or if I'm calling mark time, right, we're mark timing, and I go forward, march, I called it on my right foot, that's fucked up, I should be calling it on my left foot, so then what you'll do, column, or forward, march, you'll be like, oh, boom, right? Yeah. Mark time, march. In step, in step. Forward, march, don't anticipate. There you go, better, much better. Go on. Column left, march. What I mean, when I'm talking about the pivot points, I mean stay in your spot, don't move. We're making a full 90 degree turn, stay in your spot, mark time in place, and pivot, alright? Column right, march. So if I call column right, you're the one guy, keep going, keep going. Column right, march."

509,DSCN1252.MOV, The incline is good for you. I hope there's a straight up section. Then we climb.
510,DSCN1258.MOV," Action is meaningless as divorce from speech. Your speech must strengthen your actions and your action must strengthen your speech. To organize is to proudly proclaim to the world, look what I have built for my brothers and imagine what I can build for you. Activism and organizing is the practice of constructing windows into the world you seek to offer to those you seek to represent. Only after this window is constructed and given insight can a door be made to give new purpose to this viewer. One second. Both moral and tactical queries define the validity of an action. For example, while some laws are certainly unjust, creations of the elite class, and justifiably worthy of contempt, this moral condition alone is not enough to validate a tactic of breaking said law. It must also be judged on the tactical worth of the action itself. Is the risk capable of justifying the reward? Is there even a reward? How do you judge or mitigate the risk? These are all integral components of judging action. You must play by the rules you have, not the ones you want, even if you must break them or mean to break them. Tactically, logistically, and pragmatically, we must risk as little as feasible for the greatest gain. This is simply an equation of resource allocation. In matters of our ideal, we must place our moral philosophy and conviction above all worldly comforts and material pleasures. We must always give any and all that our convictions ask of us. In all common scenarios of daily organizing, it may be very little, but we should be unflinching as to the degree of sacrifice required to live up to our convictions, because it is them that grant value to any modern comforts and material pleasures. The question merely lies in the discernment of proper actions within a space, not at all the reason for their necessity. We should give unquestioningly, once we have made the conclusion that is what is properly demanded from our ideals. Our money, our possessions, our comfort and luxuries, all that we have and all that we are including even in our lives. The greatest sacrifice should be granted with as little moral deliberation as the least, because that promise has been made. An oath has been spoken and demands to be fulfilled. Martyrdom should be your attachment to the conventional upon the altar of national liberty. True freedom exists in the absence of fear and the sureness of purpose. The theme that I think is integral to that section that I read is about the fact that really ultimately, nationalism is an action-based ideology. We can talk about it, we can read about it, we can learn about it, we can watch videos on YouTube or look at memes about it. But when it comes down to it, if you truly wish to call yourself a nationalist, or dissident right, or fascist, any of these kinds of terms, it requires that you apply those beliefs in action, or else you are simply an observer. You are maybe a sympathizer or appreciator of these ideas, but not truly a believer. I think it also indicates something kind of personal to myself. One of the biggest goals I've had in the recent past and while in the Wildout has been weight loss. I've been trying my best to make a lot of gains, or I guess losses, when it comes to that. I think that the dedication to sacrificing material pleasure and comfort for the greater good of your brothers, and the organization, and the moral philosophies underpinning your interests, is really key to that. It's done a lot to motivate me. I often look at, when I'm trying to lose weight, I look at it less so as I'm doing this for myself, even though I do that to some extent, but largely look at it as, it's unfair for my brothers to have to be someone who has not solved this problem yet. I think it's important that all of us, not shy away from, but embrace struggle. Struggle is ultimately the key to our ancestors' success, and the shirking of that struggle, fearing it and running away from it, is the key to their failures, and why we are here today. So we must all embrace struggle, for the greater good of our families, our kids, and our community."

522,DSCN1281.MOV," Okay, technically for drilling purposes, I think we use our suits. Whose suits? This is the autonomous zone. This is the George Floyd autonomous zone.

There you go."
523,DSCN1282.MOV, Ready? Forward. Hold. Hold. Break through. Break through. There you go. Good job Johnny.
524,DSCN1283.MOV," Step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, halt, turn. Okay. Alright, instead of saying step, say 1, 2, 3. So we actually know how many steps are left. Now, normally in all the other formations we turn leftward, but how do we know when to turn? In this case, we would just be told to turn. How about you call the turnout, or whoever's in front calls the turnout also. So once you get to 10, you say halt, and then say left or right, and that's the way that guys turn. Sam, you're going to do this. Okay, step, step, step, halt, turn. So count by numbers. Okay, you're going to count your steps. Yes, count the steps. So count to 10. So guys know that they should be in the same pace. So let's say they're on step 2, but you just called 3, they say, okay, I need to hurry up, you know, I'm behind. So, right."
525,DSCN1284.MOV," So next time we're going to face Carter. Yep. So since you're facing me, Johnny, call turn left. OK. All right. So now we're facing Carter. I'll stand down here to make it so I'm. Ready?"
526,DSCN1285.MOV," 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Ready. Halt. Turn. Halt. Turn left. And you're going to say the direction of where you're turning. Left first. It's OK."
527,DSCN1286.MOV," 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, halt, turn right. Very good job everybody, very good."
528,DSCN1287.MOV," Ready, forward, 1, 2, 3. You got it? Yes, so my question is why is it on this side? Because you're watching his steps now. He's the guy who you're going to line your feet up with. So he might as well just do the shout out too. So he's going to do that now? Yeah, whoever's on the end should do that now. Always make sure, so we did it on that end because these ends are staggered, right? See that? So we're just going to do the even end, the correct, you know. There's two guys there. There's no one behind Randy."
529,DSCN1288.MOV," That's correct. The guy at the end is setting it. Line your feet up with the guy at the end. No, his end is staggered. We'll do that end again. Good. Okay, they all need to be matching Tyler's feet. So if Tyler's foot is more forward than yours, move your foot forward with his. That looks good. Ready? Ready. Forward. Step one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Halt. Turn left. Some of you guys turned the wrong way. I know that you turned my way, as I said, but he did say left. So let's do a mystery call out. The guy at the end, say left or right. Let's see if anyone can get it right. Because you're not going to know all the time which way you're turning. You're going to have to learn to hear the call out. If you don't hear the call out, just see which way your guys turn before you turn. You don't want to turn the other way, because that could be bad."
530,DSCN1289.MOV," Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Halt. Turn left. Great job."
531,DSCN1290.MOV," Forward, march! Halt! Turn right. Okay, there's a gap here. Guess what? Antifa's jumped in between. Pushed you out of the way and now they're behind you. They go on, they bash Zack's head in. It's your fault."
532,DSCN1291.MOV," Hold. Left face. There you go. Good work. Not bad. A little spacey at the end, but not bad."
533,DSCN1292.MOV," I died. Yeah, don't look for the legs. There you go. Nice."
534,DSCN1293.MOV," Yeah. Grab that leg. Yes. It's all right. Make sure. There we go. And you're going to get him to a car, to a hospital, or to a medic who's not available."
535,DSCN1294.MOV, He acts like he's done it a hundred times.
536,DSCN1295.MOV," And you need to hey, hey, do it. Hey, do it."
537,DSCN1296.MOV," This carry he has to be conscious to put his arms around us. If he's unconscious he couldn't do this. So there you go. You're grabbing my wrist? I'm grabbing you back here. We're grabbing each other's lips. One, two, three, then lift. One, two, three, up. Perfect guys. Yes, and you want to keep his back more elevated so it's more of a seat instead of a slouch. You don't want him like pinching himself."
538,DSCN1297.MOV," between him and grab right here. Oh, that's awesome. You're lifting him up under his arms and going like that. Easy, guys. Easy, easy. Yes. And since you're in the back, well, it doesn't really matter. But one person might be able to do one, two, three, go. Yeah, the people on the same. He's happily unconscious there. I'll say one, two, three, on three. All right. Make sure you do one, two, three. One, two, three, go. All right, take him to safety. Don't drop his head. Don't drop his head. Put him down. Put him down. That's good. That's good. That looks terrible on his arms. Is he supposed to lock his arms like this?"
539,DSCN1298.MOV," You're gonna fuck them. Alright. Alright, does anyone else want to try that? I'd like to. Okay, good. Alright, so before you go, make sure both of you are ready. And then count out 1, 2, 3. Up. I'll do the back, so I'll count it. Okay, so you're gonna call the count? Yep. 1, 2, 3."
540,DSCN1299.MOV," It would probably be better for the guy in the back. Alright, on three, on three, ready? Hold up. One, two, three. Go, go, go. Give him to a car. Alright, alright, it's good."
541,DSCN1301.MOV," It's only as funny as until it happens. Okay, okay, he's grabbing his knees. Okay, I'm deleting that one. God damn. Don't grab by his boots, okay? What if his boot slips off, right? Then it's over. Grab him by his knees, pretty much. Jesus, okay. That was funny."
542,DSCN1302.MOV," Okay, Zach, you should have went to that side. Yep. Alright, it's okay. Get in line. Get in line again. Line up with each other. Okay, he got kicked out of his position on this side. Weren't you on this side? Yeah. Okay, switch down with him just so he's in the same spot every time. I just told myself I should go right every time. Yes, you are going to go back to that side. Get in position with the guy next in line with you. Like fit in place. So, John, do you have a question? No. Okay. Alright, so Sam, you're going to yell."
543,DSCN1303.MOV," Alright, he backed up. File in. Make sure you're going the right way. Okay. Sam, yeah, Sam you went to the wrong side. Yep. Go to the side you're already on from the center. Alright, line up. Do it again. Yo, center back. He knows to back up. Wrong side. Do it again. Get back up here and do it again. We're doing it right. Yo, center back. Center back. No, wrong. You're next. You're in pairs of two. Two, two, two. Alright, that's fine. Let's do it again. Center back, baby. I think we got it. So basically, you're going back here, right? It's correct. We get this right and then... It's gonna be badass. Okay, so it's like a stream. Yes. It's like a drain. Okay, so you guys are kind of curved here in the middle. There you go. There you go. Okay. Do it when you're ready. Center back. Clark, you're supposed to take the front position. Yeah, last guy through stays in the front. That's okay. It was your first try. But you got it. Okay, so get back in line. Tyler, just take the spot behind Johnny. Alright, good. The guy in the far right is the guy that sits in the middle. That's correct. Because since we're going left to right, he'd be the last remaining guy. It's like three paragraphs, right? In a sentence. And the last sentence would be him. Got it? Clark? Center back. There you go. Johnny, go. Is that... No, he went to the wrong side, didn't he? Michael, other side. Yeah, Michael did. I think so, did he? He did go to the wrong... Yeah, someone switched sides. It's alright. It is tricky. Some people understand my weird analogy. Some don't. What I'm saying was, if we have three groups, right? In six sentences for each person. The last sentence would be the last guy at the end. He takes a position. I keep saying different ways people understand. Some understand the dream. Some might be accountants. To me, it's a zipper. Yes, but not everyone sees it as that. You can call it out that way if you want. Like you said, it's like a zipper. But I'm trying to keep zipper formation being a staggered formation and this to be a straight line formation. A zipper also looks like the zipper you guys were doing with your shields. When he says center back, take a little more. Yeah, there you go. Measurement, yep. Center back. Now, then you move back forward. Perfect. Now the line just collapsed back. Perfect. Yeah, as many times as it takes to get it perfect. Johnny fills a gap. Now you guys spread out a little too much. He would be to the left. He is center back every time. He should back up, but he should stand not to the right because that's the wrong row of his. He should be to his left. Okay, change places a little. Okay, we're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Okay, change places a little. Yep, I know. Okay, now when he says center back, you're just going to back up and you're going to back up and you're going to be like this. Showing that there's a gap here, right? There is no video for center back. This is something that we have to produce. I can do that. I can do that for you. Okay, so now you were center back, and now you're going to call out center back and you're going to go in position. Ready? Center back. Very good. Very good. Good. Good. And Tyler takes... Nope. Johnny just changed places with Benjamin. That changes center back though. We don't want to change center back. Yeah, what's going on there?"
544,DSCN1304.MOV, Alright Johnny call it out. Center back. Very good. See we had a new center. Yeah Michael you're all over the place. Johnny you should have went all the way to the end. I thought I was going to hole again. Zach's got a little spur. So you go all the way to the back end. Ok hang on. When you since you called center back you go behind him to the very end. So when he calls center back now back up give the room for the guys to fill up around you. Once everyone fills up step in position. Ok whenever you're ready Allen.
545,DSCN1305.MOV," Alright Clark, call it out. Center back. Good job Johnny. Wrong! Michael, you went to the wrong side. That's alright, reform your line. Yeah, you're running out of space back there. It's okay. It's okay. Everyone's, you know, got to learn it. It's a team, definitely a team skill here. This ain't easy. This does look cool. This is very efficient. There you go, there you go. Fill the gap, fill the gap. Wrong. You have to fill the gap since you're the last guy on the end. You are now in the front. You're protecting all the people in the back now. That's alright. Now it's your turn to yell center back. Center back. Randy, get out of the way. There you go. Correct, correct, correct. Alan fills. Alan, make the call out. Center back. Sorry, Adam, make the call out to Adam. There you go. Wrong side, wrong side Adam. Have Alan come back up to the front and do that again just so he can get it down, which way to go. So take his spot. Take Adam's spot, sorry. Adam, Alan, sorry, I keep getting mixed up. Yeah, take his spot. What I meant to say is you're now the call out guy and he's now the guy backs up. Okay. Make sure it's even guys. Guy in the back, make sure you're lined up directly with the guy. There you go. Okay, everyone in position? Okay, Adam, make the call out. Center back. Alan backs up. Correct side, correct, correct, correct. Hang on, whoa. He... Ulysses needs to get back there and then you take the spot. You kind of got behind him. So since you got behind him, he can't back up then. He's locked up on you, right? So let's keep doing it. Get in line. Here, buddy. For the person who's moving back, I guess your position is the center back. If the guy who's supposed to fill in the gap starts moving back too far, push them back into the spot. Yeah, good idea. Don't let them come too far back. Hold them there because then they'll think, oh, I fucked up, and they'll stop. Yeah, don't be afraid to kind of intervene with the guys around. Because as the guy going back, you're kind of the observer. You're the easiest guy. Yeah, one push could protect someone from getting bashed in the face. This is a harsh reality, right? Okay. He is peeking right now. All right, ready? Center back. Okay, something weird happened. That's all right. Keep going. Go slower, guys, until we get it perfect. So, interviewee, it's your turn now to yell center back. Center back. Okay, correct, correct, correct, correct, perfect. Randy, yell center back. Center back. Wrong. That's all right. Where did it go wrong? The line was kind of wonky. I think you should have backed up. Since the line wasn't perfectly aligned, the center back became the wrong guy. Which will confuse the guys that just are like, you know, they'll be going way out here then. And they'll be like, oh, that line's already full. They'll be like, what the heck? Where do I go? Where do I go? Right? Whoever is the physical, like whoever is the center back, right, get back, right? The guys are going to start falling in, and you just make sure that you are behind the line. And then you're just going to, I believe it is, step to the left, right? Fall in to the left side. Stand there and wait until you need to refill the gap. Wherever the hole ends up, just fill it. Yeah, wherever the hole ends up, then you can fill it if it doesn't go according to plan. Yes, correct. That way you as the center back are behind the line itself."

Get him higher up. There you go. Higher up, higher up. Josh, stop biting him. He's dragging off. Yeah!"
571,Fireman_Carry_11.MP4," Nice. We're ready. Your turn. Your turn for a ride, John. I just can't squat. I can't squat."
572,Fireman_Carry_2.MP4, Thanks for watching!
573,Fireman_Carry_3.MP4, Appreciate it.
574,Fireman_Carry_4.MP4, Stack all night. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
575,Fireman_Carry_5.MP4," Yeah, I'm good. I'm gonna buy you another hat from Amazon. It's okay."
576,Fireman_Carry_6.MP4, Journalist! Come on! Back straight! Yeah!
577,Fireman_Carry_7.MP4," There's some more people get on my head. Not yet, don't jump him."
578,Fireman_Carry_8.MP4," I need to get my shoulders. Yeah, watch your feet. Don't come here. But down. So it'll be on your shoulders, not on your back. I don't know if I can get him with one leg. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, if he's too big, we can two man carry. Max, can you help him with a two man carry? You want to do it so I can film you? Yeah. Okay."
579,Fireman_Carry_9.MP4, A guy put my delivery in there. He has. Good job. Do Conant
580,Fireman_carry_and_Holding_the_line.MP4," So, what's going on? What are you doing? What do you want? No, I was just like, we get them up like this. Are you going side to side or front to side? Yeah, side to side, yeah. Left half, right half? That's a weird greasing, man. Are you going over the shoulder? Yeah. Okay. We can do this. I mean, it's really, it's really... You can hold hands too. Yeah. It's really locking them. That's better grip. That's the way to carry them out. I was thinking of the way where you get... But if he's out... If he's out, you can drag him by the leg. You can go either way. You can just grab his foot and drag that. You can do it. If he crosses his arms, you go underneath and you drag it so his head, he can stay. That's a one man. Oh, you're talking about two, I got you. That actually is another carry, something you can do if you need to get somebody out there. It's really easy. Well, I saw you there. Did you get him? He's out there on the leg. Yeah, so that way you have support. If his arms, if he's caving... I doubt we're going to run into somebody totally clocking out cold, but we might. Worst case scenario. Yeah, you never know when one of your buddies just passes out because he was stupid and didn't hydrate, or if, you know, some antifa hits him right in the head with a rock. Who knows? You remember everyday life. Yeah. Still good to know. Anything can happen. Yeah. Yes. These actually do help a lot. I'm going to dig in a brain breeze. Okay. So we don't want to cover the other secondary two man carry. Go ahead and be a show, Norman. Okay, so back down on the ground. You'll be behind him. Okay. This is one way to do it. I like your way too, and it's going to depend. You've got to be careful in a heated situation that you don't go down wobbly on your knees and screw yourself up. It's almost better to take your time, get a good grip. As soon as I get this, I need to start lifting. Get here. That's one way to do it. I don't know if we want to pick a preference or just use it because it's an emergency. You're going to use what you've got. I think we need a pregnant with Sean. Yeah, let's do it. You're the casualty. You get the legs and stand up like that. And if he's totally out, you can just fold him up. So he comes out. I'm going to roll him up. Yeah, get down behind him. Get here. Like so. That might just be preference. You good? Yeah. That might be preference. I like the side to side too. All right, you all cycle through that. Get another person. Two men. Two. All right, we're going to do it like one in. Which one are we doing? Go do side to side, two men carry in front of it. All right, two men carry. Here, I've been to the dummies. One of you guys has been there. And I'm dead for it. Ryan and Jack, you guys carry the mattress. Forward or forward. I volunteer. I'm trying to get something to do. Drop your butt a little bit. Yeah, so I'll check this out. Slow down. Stop here. Go back down. So when you get down to this guy. And granted, if you're going high speed, you're going to grab what you can get. But what I would like to do, this can throw my back out. Bad juju, you go down to help your buddy tweak your back. And now you're down too. Even if we're in a high speed scenario and you're getting stuff thrown at you, I highly encourage you can even drop a knee if you need to. Roll this guy up. Brace your knee. Get up under him and get what's called a gable grip. You can do S grips. Don't interlace your fingers. Gable grip. I get under here. I tighten it. I get my hips up in here. Yeah, it looks funny. And people aren't used to it unless you've been doing grappling. Get up in there so that I got everything I need to pull up with my legs. If I go down and try to do this wobbly back thing, you might screw your back up. Yeah. All right, well, let's get more grips going at once. Oh, yeah, good idea. Try that again. Good, good. Three guys in here again. I know. I need to know. I'll hold it. All right, I'll hold it. This is the guy in front. I can only act here. I'll show you again. Stay here. Good. We're going to break this down step by step so you guys get what's needed. And again. You can do it this way. You can do it side to side. One reason I encourage dropping the knees is because I'm kind of tall. If I try to get all this done down here, I'm way past my final point. That's not a good squat. I can get down here, and I want to wedge this right here. I get up under here. When I get in, it's crucial that you pull your hips in, straighten your back, and look up. Okay? That's the concept I want to see. That's the concept I want to see is the hips engaged. It really does help to have lifted or having grappled. That's why we're here out of the training. So back down and grab. Go slow. Think a little bit about what you're doing. Let's see what you're doing when you're right here and you're in the back. So you're here. If it feels more comfortable, you can drop on me to get into shape. Because when you get his legs, you want to get good and deep. I want to pull up under. I want it to be around the knees. If I just go through, he's pulling all the way. If I get here and I kind of just do this number, no bueno. I want to get up in here. I'm going to lift nice. He's got to be so close. I'm going to get in here. I'm going to last stand really tight here. I don't want to be counting on my legs. I want to push away, pull. I think that's what it is. Just wait for the back and then just do the squat. All I did was just get underneath. Yeah. Squat it out. Yeah. I want to try this on Ryan just so I can kind of get a feel for it. Push with your lighter obliques. All right. Who wants to? Oh, no. I'm bigger. I'm faster than you. When you sit him down. Yeah. Front to him down. I want him to have the HP on that. I mean, not as much as I can. Okay. Ready? Nope. Nope. You got a little worry. All right. Yeah, communication's key. We don't have to do it in silence. As long as we can get the legs together. Yeah, that's a good note. Usually the guy in the back is the one initiating the lift. You don't even need to be able to do that one. Just swing him. Just get him to throw him towards the back. I got to really work on my arm. And then you're going to do the same thing you were doing. I got him. There you go. Not bad. Better. Yeah. And I'm not light either. Okay. Let's see here. We did the carry. That's pretty much it as far as, you know, saving casualties, right? Jack, you had something to add to this? More so it kind of just goes into the medical camp. A little brief first aid. First aid workshop. I mean, again, I have pamphlets for everyone. You just want to hand them out at the end of this thing? Yeah. And I'm down to have every single member go through local, mandatory AED CPR, like a day course. Not a bad idea. No, I mean, it might save a life. And then everybody have first aid. I've got like a surgical kit in my backpack. If everybody knows medical, you'll have almost no casualties. Well, everyone needs basic first aid knowledge. For sure. And it's just so simple and easy to get. And even if their knowledge is limited, if two men can get it out, and two are medic, you know what I mean, that's going to be critical as well. Okay. Let's see here. I was thinking about ready to go into marching, didn't I? Marching, didn't you? Oh, yes, we're going to go to some counter-arrest techniques, right? So this would be a good area for that right here. All right, five people down there, and then five men down here. Clarification, this is more for the flag guys, right? Yeah, this is going to be for the main column. Right. Yeah. Assuming, yeah, the cops break through the shields and they get to the flag guys, this is what we're going to do basically. Well, that's actually bringing up a pretty good point, because if the cops are coming after shields, they're going to have to— We can ask the guys that have cops uniforms in their backpacks, are they— Yeah, no, they're coming after shields. Well, that's something we're going to have to discuss, too. Yeah. If two militants look at us, that's when they start to answer. Anyway, we'll figure it out. I think we can still do it if you lock the shield on. Yeah, you can still do it. In fact, you can probably, like— That's probably something good to go over. Let's get some feeling. For right now— If we're all in uniform, we're all moving. Not saying don't hit the cops, but like— For right now— Don't, obviously, but like you can— Don't be like scared. Don't treat them like, you know, they're the blind shot. Just reach for their belt. I need 10 more guys down there. Just reach for the gun. They like that. Go ahead, Jack. Okay, perfect. Okay. Everybody assemble. You guys are going to be— Don't be scared. You guys are going to be the column. You guys are going to be the cops, okay? We're cops. Now, go. I want you—I want 100 percent, okay? You're going to try to get these guys broke up and arrested. These guys are going to be defending. This is just simple. You just lock arms and hold tight. You got a preference on over, under? Not really. Okay, good. Gable grip helps here, too, if you got it. You don't have a shield. I don't know if the shields are going to give us— I want you guys— Clarification. Get the cops coming. You drop the flag. And like, they broke up your shield to try and get people. You drop your flag where it is. Are all tactics available? Lock in. The flag won't matter at this point. It's your safety more important. You got your hands, okay? Don't kick them in the balls. Are they not just going to start throwing? I don't want you to throw. Probably, but you know what? What? I'm really sick for the action report. Quench blood holes. Okay. Are we going now? Are you guys ready? All right, cops are coming. Go. Cops are coming. Here we go. Go. No kicks. One hundred— There you go. Cops got me out. What happened? What happened? All right, time. All right, Logan. I was looking at you. I was looking at you. All right, Logan. I was looking at you. You good, Logan? All right. Yeah, I'm good. Well, that's what it's going to be. Oh, yeah. I like it. It's kind of like grabbing a needle. I came undone. I'm good. Very nice. Okay. Thanks for doing that. All right, get back over there. Reset. Reset. All right, now we do it now. All right, let me get my head out of here. No, we're doing it now. I'll admit right now, I specifically picked him because he was the weak link and he was the smallest guy in the line. That's what they'll do. I'm sure that's what they'll do. And they will do this. They will do this. And they will do that. Get him in the middle. Get him in the middle. Hold me like you love me. Hold on, guys. Guys, guys. Hey, no. Pull him down. Hold up, y'all. I know sometimes you might not be able to help it, but if you can, if you see a guy like this, get him in between two bigger guys. Yeah. Hey, be careful. You might get wedged. So listen if somebody does say tap because you're going to be the one that says it, so. Okay. All right, now you guys are going to have to react, so I don't want you to lock arms right now. You see them coming. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to lock arms. I'm going to lock arms. I'm going to lock arms. Okay, now you guys are going to have to react, so I don't want you to lock arms right now. You see them coming. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. You guys are going to have to react. Okay, I'm going to get fast. All right. Okay, they're like Tom. Oh, wait, Tom out. I got the people coming. Remember, we're filming a YouTube video. Over diversity. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay."

595,GH010022.MP4," Yeah, let's do two of them. I'll take your left, I'll take my right. What? I'll choose sides. Let's do this side. Yeah. You got any gay shit up here that needs covering up? Shine your light on me. I'm looking for my headlamp, not thinking. Yeah, there's a penis right there. Yeah, I'll cover that bag shit up. Yeah. Yeah, let's open that up. Check, thank you.

What do we do? Alright, I want Mark to spray it, and Sam to spray onto the picture. Okay. Yeah, I like the spot I found, though, that parking spot there. It's a fucking bee's knees, ain't it? It is a bee's knees. Now, I didn't know there was a path way all the way to this. Alright, let's go, let's save this one. There we go. You think Revolution will fit in there? Yes, it will. Alright, let's give it a minute. See if there's any white you can. Yes. How much you got in mind this time, guy? What? How much you got in mind this time? Uh, we'll do Revolution in red, Iz in blue. It's not really matter. Here, we also have black. You can always do Iz in black or something. Yeah, I'm going to switch it up a little bit. Revolution in red, Iz in black, and then Tradition in blue. Right. Ooh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll do that. I'm mixing it up. So, who's spraying? I am. Sam's going to spray and Carson will spray. Alright, I'll record you guys. I'd like us to learn how to do this very quickly. Somebody tell me when this is level and then you're ready. Let's start bringing it in level with this. Don't spray yet. It looks pretty good. You know what you can do is hang on, hang on. Line up the bottom of the cut of the concrete. There you go. There you go. Perfect. There. Perfect. You guys got the same colors or what? Same colors. Good job, Clark. Very good. Very good. Alright, Clark's getting it down now. You're in focus. You're in focus, right. That's what happens. Nice. Very nice. Alright. Good job. Alright. A little bleeding. Alright, that's fine. You know what you're doing? You're too close with the can. Yeah. Back it up. Revolution. Kind of, but also sloppy. How's that look to you guys? Line up with the bottom. Good. Okay, about that far. Back up your spray. Perfect. There you go. You can still get it fast. Pepper it. There you go. Now you're getting it. Nice. Very good. Put that O. Yeah, there you go, Clark. Now you're getting it. I'm going to do a picture of all four of you guys. You basically want to dust it on there. There. A little too close, but that was good. Okay. Yeah, nice. Perfect. Much better. Nice. Black is, right? We're doing a black is. Okay. Centering is. Is that too low? That's fine, right there. I think that's pretty good. Right there. Yeah, I think you can go a little to the right. Just up there. A little to the right. Right there. Yes, because lucian is actually more to the right of the foot block. Revolution is, oh God. Oh my God. Yeah. All right, Samson. There you go. Nice. Very nice. Yep, yep, yep. Perfect. That'll work. Looks great. Yeah, is is really bold now. Utilizing the black spray paint. Some blue? Yeah. Some blue. Let's just get all sorts of colors. All right. Tradition is. There we go. How many of those lines do I have? We should get some gray spray paint. Is this good? You should line it up with, okay, you need to go traditional. Grab the rest of the letter. Grab the rest of the word. The rest of the word. All right, we're done. Hang on, hold it up there. Let me see if it's actually going to be. Okay, hang on. Turn some light. Go more to the right. Stop. I can't see Kyle with you standing like that. Hold on, I got it. Bring my way a little bit.

It's a little different. It's old school. It's pretty old. Yeah. Okay, thank you. All right. Is that all of them? Yeah, I went all four of you guys, and I would like to borrow someone's headlamp. Are you going to do the fascies? Oh, sorry. I know you guys ain't done them yet. Yeah, get the fascies done on both sides. That's kind of like the Network 12 trademark, the fascies. The fascies? Yeah, black. Bro. You know what you should do? We didn't bring them, did we? You should do black, but make the blade. I don't have it. It's fine. Oh, he's got it. Here, we have it. Make the blade red, though. The blade. The blade. I'd say you do straight up and down, and you line it up again. This edge, put the top of that in. And this blade here, the edge, make that red. Just a little detail on this thing. Make this edge red. Two people have got to hold this thing, though. Got it out there, Clark? Yep. It's cockeyed. Yep, that's right, Sam. Show them how exactly you want it. That looks pretty good. Everything black would be the edge. Yeah, I'm going to do the edge. I'm going to do the edge. That looks pretty good. Everything black would be the edge, right? Yep."

598,GH010032.MP4," America! Reclaim America! Reclaim America! Reclaim America! Life, Liberty, Victory! Life, Liberty, Victory! We stand on the doorstep of pirates. When as once united states, there is a far cry for ourselves and our posterity. But as liberty may rule, the land jostles with the blood of patriots. Behind us is one of politicians who dare call themselves representatives, throwing us an American nightmare, rest in the dreams. Now we awake, now we demand justice. The cries of America's hopeless fall upon death rows inside these halls. The dead lose their destruction, these nearly-dead powers, which are on the way of salvation, are being piloted by their imperialistic ambitions. In an art puppet service, they are puppets, formed up by self-interest, with the rise of their extent in a twigged election cycle. We've been abandoned by the government of false-honor-stilts, usurped by plutocracy and foreign entanglement. The United States is no longer of America. Now we're on our own. The lobbyists, voters and policy-makers tell you that you are free. They will tell you that they are the defenders of freedom, who look against tens of millions, but nothing less than enslavement. We say no! We will not silently watch our people be dispossessed and drugged into apathy while our homeland is destroyed by the vengeful spurs of bureaucrats and sordid criminals. We reject the order that treats Americans like expendable items of contempt. Today, we will stop the oppression of our people. Today, we will stop the consent of the governed. With a brave and unwavering resistance, we will defend the life of our nation, so that national sovereignty may grace this continent ravaged by greed and injustice. We will admonish our people, make their deaths at the hands of foreign gangs, crooked police or dehumanizing corporations. We seek the collective liberty to abeyond the extent of threat of a government elephants on a palace in the will of a bird that's faithful to their nation. The liberty to a life of virtue without persecution. The liberty to enjoy a tomorrow where Americans alone decide and dictate their American destiny. America's future must be decided by those who include American citizens. The torch of revolution has been lit. And we will not rest until we have a destiny worthy of those who have earned it. We will reclaim our sovereignty. We will reclaim our liberty. We will reclaim our destiny. And we will reclaim America! Reclaim America! Reclaim America! For the life of our nation. For the liberty of our people. For the victory of the American people. Victory! Up, level, attack, life, liberty, victory! Tch. Forward, fight! Face them right, guys. Face them right. To your right. We had to stop presenting, but... Shields! Shields! Shields! Shields! Go, take the back. Take that back! Stay tight. I feel like Rosa Parks right outside the African History Museum. I feel like Martin Luther King Jr. right now. No, you're a hero. Ha ha ha ha. You are, you are, you are. Fight back, fight back! One more, one more, do it again. One more leg! One more leg!

Come on, say something to me! Come on! I know you want to! I heard that little chuckle. I can see your beard from your fucking mask. Your mask is soft, by the way. What are you, like a ginger? Gingers can't even donate sperm. You can't even donate sperm to further your little white race. Because you're a goddamn ginger. And that is the goddamn truth. How does that feel, ginger? Does that feel good? I think she's microaggressing against you. Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Look, I got onto their skin! And I made the one there mad. You can't further your own race. No one wants your little sperm. That must be really sad. Very emasculated. Your t-shirt is donating sperm. You can't donate sperm to your ginger. Don't talk. Don't talk. Do you have anything to say for yourself? Come on! Nothing? You guys can only say five words at one time? That must be really emasculating, being told what to do. A-63, do you copy? So you're just taking a video of the people in front of you? On your little GoPro? That's pretty fucking stupid. That's a really shitty video. At least turn it towards me. You boys are boring.

Wait, wait, it's done, it's done, it's done. Let's go up over there. Wait, where's Michael at? Uh-huh. Yeah, this is a sand road. Michael might have left early, I'm not sure. Yeah, there's probably a way to get through this, though. Uh, you would have had to cross back over this way. I don't know, we'll see. Is it down there, or is it the Penn State area, right? Um, I guess. Over there is where we climbed up on the other side of this bridge. Do you want to try and egress out this way in case there's a toe pole? Um, I guess. I have no idea how easily we can get down here. That might be a lot worse than it looks. Yeah. Let's go. You don't have a phone on you, do you? I do. Tell him we're exactly where we entered, except the opposite side of the road. Out of sight. Ah. Alright, let's go. Back up a little bit. Keep going. Keep going."

I wasn't making fun of you, Thomas. Sorry. You'll be the first person thrown in the American internment camp. You'll get your own suite. Alright. So, let's see. I don't know if I see people up ahead. I was just telling him, that's Thomas. What conditioner he uses. You heard that, Tom? What kind of conditioner do you use? Alright, so it looks like we got a chain link type of fence thing over here. Alright. Alright. So, let's go around this way. We got like three squad cars just chilling. It looks like traffic on this road is not permitted. Alright. Alright. So, this area is fenced off. Emergency parking. 10-16, 10-16. Alright, so this is just for today, it appears. Like, you see these signs? It says 10-16, 10-16. They don't have vehicular traffic on this side."

I think. Oh, a footage? Yeah. Wow. I got the one GoPro I bought for like 40 bucks. It's like a Hero 3. And I went to this... I bought it straight from a slo-mo. I mean I'm talking about poster propaganda. It looked just like... Oh, man. Huh? If only he knew what I was going to use it for. Yeah, seriously. I don't think that this is meant to actually be."
605,GH010074.MP4," Alright, so now we're on the other side by where the Supreme Court is. There's an open fence area that I don't know if we're allowed in or not. Okay, it says visitor center here. Property of U.S. Capitol Police. I don't want to walk in and have them be like, what are you doing in here by the way? Why do you have a GoPro on? But... Oh look, there's like, whatchamacallit over there. There's like people with umbrellas over there. Hmm. Alright, well it says visitor center so we'll just go right up to the cop and ask. Yeah, is this good? Alright, I appreciate it. Haha, you've got a really shiny photo in there. That's shiny fool. This is where that, uh, isn't that Shaman? Yes, let's not talk about that stuff right now because we got like tons of uh... Alright, you guys are definitely gonna just be posing for pictures the whole time. Alright, so this whole area is open on this side. We can go up to the whole thing. It's all fenced in, but I mean that actually might play to our advantage because to be frank, if they arrest us, they arrest us. The only thing though is that they will be able to react and shut those fences on us. As soon as like word gets out there's a PF demo going on in DC, all they're gonna do is shut those those uh fences likely. But there is another one right there. That's the Supreme Court building right there. Alright, we'll get that in a minute. Let's get you guys a picture in front of the Capitol.

615,HasanAbi_Reacts_to_White_Supremacist_March_at_Lincoln_Memorial.mp4," Alright folks, let's get to some fun news. Okay? Nazis. What are they up to? What are they wearing? What are they doing? Well, yesterday, a group of white nationalists marched towards the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. These little piss babies were running around with their wee-wees. And you will notice some differences, both in the size of the march and how the march was received and what they looked like. Let's take a look at what was going on at this fascist march in D.C. Now, right off the bat, I just gotta point something out. Masks, bro? What's up? Masks, bro? Why are you guys wearing masks, you pussies? What's the deal? I thought masks... I thought masks were the real killers. What's happening there? Also another fun thing. You shouldn't platform these events. Even when you're riffing on them, the less exposure they get, the better. Yeah, totally. No, I will absolutely dunk on a failure of a fucking march. What happened? Why are you guys not showing your faces? I mean, I remember a time when Nazis were not afraid to show their fucking faces. What happened? Did all those Antifa motherfuckers actually unmask a lot of you and reach out to your employers one by one? Is that why you have to feel the need to hide your identity again? Huh? Is that what happened? What's up? So, what's really funny about this... First of all, what a beautiful service dog. Beautiful dog. What's really funny about this fucking fascist march is that, of course, I was making fun of them and immediately people were like, oh, dude, yeah, Nazis, bro, sure. It's like, no, dude, they called themselves that. Oh, dude, we're not in... There are still people, no matter where you go on the internet, there are always still people that will fucking defend Nazis with the age-old antiquated... It's not 1938 in Germany. A guy that will defend them, I'm like, motherfucker, they say they're Nazis. What's wrong with you? Was it this? Oh, yeah, we're going to show this in a second, hold on. There's a good ending to this story. There was this one fucking guy in my mentions that was like, hmm, dude, you think everyone's a Nazi. And it's like, yeah, no, I think that this guy definitely is a Nazi, okay? Like, this homie straight up... This homie straight up said, another moron comparing one of the worst things in human history to something not even close, pathetic. It's like, how? How are you... How? How? Like, they literally see themselves as Nazis. They're saying that they're fucking Nazis, and you're out here being like, they're not actually Nazis, okay. Got it. Well, you're ruining their propaganda for them, because they want to be known as Nazis. I'm sorry, guys. It's so weird that you get trolled by these groups. I don't visit such less frequent hate streams. What? Another video of them chanting Reclaim America. Love you. Love you. I mean, this is lame as hell, bro. I'm sorry. Like, you're literally... You're doing a march, and you're the drummer boy. Like, that's so whack, dude. Like, that's... They're so fucking lame, dude. The upside down flags are because they think America is lost. Because, you know, brown people. America is lost because brown people exist in it now. Love you, asshole. So, this was an older video of the same group. This is an older video of the same group. We'll show that in a second, but let's deal with the coverage. We can agree that... One is too many, right? To see anyone marching a white supremacist to the Lincoln Memorial is a sight that none of us ever wants to see. There's something almost too on the nose about having a bunch of guys dressed up like they're ready to go to war. Dressed up with battle armor and shield, because in their minds, this civil war never ended, right? And what they're chanting is always so talent. Reclaim America. When was America ever taken? Who was it taken from and by whom? Well, they feel like it's been taken from white folks. But since when are brown and black people ahead? Right? Since when are white men still not on top? You're applying logic to their anxiety. My point is to say, there's something so remarkable about having self-avowed white nationalists, white supremacists, marching on a memorial for somebody who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It just sort of exemplifies the country's ongoing struggle with racism. Yeah. And look, the fact that we're seeing an acceleration in the wake of Charlottesville, that these are young folks and they're masking and they're carrying shields and battle armor, which of course is a sign of their own weakness. These are weak, anxious people trying to find definition and strength in this kind of militaristic white nationalist nonsense. The reason it's more than just a bunch of clowns trying to march on the Lincoln Memorial is the ADL found that this particular group, the Patriot Front, was responsible for 80% of the white supremacist propaganda found on campus and elsewhere in 2020. And it's a young person's movement. This isn't just a bunch of old cranks waving their fist at the sky about how the country is changing. Leaders 23 years old. I will tell you, they were wearing masks. One of the things I felt that was most chilling about Charlottesville was people walking around unmasking. Here I am. I have no shame over this. We are free to express ourselves because that's where we think we are in this country right now. They didn't want their identities known. Yeah. Do you know who also wore masks and face coverings? I mean, I don't want to think we want to take too much cover. No, I'm not. But I'm saying there's a difference here. And I don't know whether it's not that they think that the attitude in the country is different towards the message that they're delivering or not. I just, you know, it is notable. But the question is really what has changed since Charlottesville, right? I mean, that's 2017. Five months with Elijah thinking he is demanual. I do think we dismiss this as sort of fringe actors. Bro. Straight up, the main reason why they have to fucking wear masks again when they're marching is literally all those fucking cringe ass anarchists on Twitter. Okay. I'm sorry to report this, but. Straight up. Antifa, you might think they're fucking lame. You might think that they're wack. You might think that they're disorganized. You might think that they're annoying. The ultimate reason why these motherfuckers have to hide and how much their movement got ripped apart was not because of the authorities. It was straight up. On the ground. Actual. No, no, this, this is before January 6th. Even at the peak. Charlottesville was a turning point. Charlottesville. Charlottesville was when they had a gigantic following. It was at the peak. Trump even fucking accelerated it further by saying there's very fine people on both sides. But the reality is those cringe ass, crusty ass anarchists. Were. You know. Unmasking all of them. Detailing it. Putting out lists. Showing their communications and correspondences. Unicorn riot. And everyone else was straight up. Sending their info to their fucking employers and whatnot. And, and, uh, that is directly the reason why. The second time they tried to do a unite the right rally. That rally was tiny. It was a fraction. Of the same size. Okay. It's just the truth. You might think that, you might think that they're crusty. But. This is one instance where they personally took a fat fucking dub. When dealing with the Nazis. And don't ask me. This is not speculation. We have the documents. Unicorn riot infiltrated their discord servers. And straight up released information. Released correspondence between some of the leaders. Where they're literally like we can't do the fucking tiki torch khaki. Behavior anymore. We can't do these big showings anymore because they literally dox us. And they go and they fucking give our info to our, you know. They give our information to our employers. And get us fired. Yo, I recently started to see woman for the first time in a long time. Been using you and wills advice hassle. So. I'm still having. There's a group in Utah that takes down Mormon nationalists. Deseret nationalists. Many have been fired because of them and they're still being fired. Not all hackers and doxes are crusty. No, but all anarchists are. There's a thick layer of crust. The more crust you have on you. The more anarchist you are. Just the truth, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ladies, gentlemen. It's just the truth. Okay. All right. Anyway. Thank you. We've got another question. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I just want to say something. Pay attention, folks. This is a problem that we need to confront. This virus of hate and white supremacy and white nationalism in our country. Is not a word. I'm sorry. I just love. I love. Even though I hyped up the anarchists and what they did. And say, and am defending them. Just because I said Krusty. Typical anarchist behavior. Why are you talking about how, oh my God, Marx is being elite. Why are you talking about how Krusty we are. Blah blah blah. It's just like, dude, don't. It's just true. I'm sorry. It's just true. I acknowledge all the time. How a lot of anarchists are. A lot of anarchists are in the forefront of these sorts of movements. They do a lot of activism. They literally go to these fucking protests. Even if they have like. High in the sky ideals. They still are. Advocates for marginal change. But there's also a lot of annoying. Shit like hyper focusing on like. Little things that get in the way of solidarity. You just. You do that. Okay. You're doing that right now. Not done. The only good thing is this one didn't turn violent. But the next one could. And that's always the concern. Laura chair John. Thank you very much."

is going to be find the weak point and get one yep oh I came down right on a rock they don't want to have to arrest everybody they just want to pull him away they whip him alright, we switching sides here? yeah ruff ruff now I lost the shit I mean, we do need to do that, what's the idea? what? we don't need to do that what the hell does that mean? we almost broke Brian's arm yeah but he's 90 pounds it's like stepping on a sparrow Indian man, small winged sparrow you can be in the top yeah, I had left the rock alright, so are you guys linking arms or are we linking arms? we're sailing oh, we're sailing, you're linking arms alright, go, link arms oh shit you can just attack them like they did us arrest him, arrest him take, take, take, take my film time, time, time you can't treat lady cops like that do it one more time oh, if a girl cop tries to unpeel me I'll be like this is pussy grab excommunicated I don't know, I'm into that shit go arrest me reach for my duty belt wait, wait, wait here they come, here they come no, no, no, no sir, no sir no sir, no sir get behind him this is a lawful thing, I don't consider I don't consider hey, we didn't even get down some of these cops are going to have to train for this, they're going to love it man they're going to go down for single legs and just snap and eat alright, one more time for the other side do one more time for the other side so we're going back that way? yep who's linking arms? us we're linking arms? here they come come on y'all, tuddle up, get circular Ryan, what are you doing man? are you hurt or something? no, we just jumped in what do you mean you jumped in there? you forgot to get in there alright he's in the NFL right now ok, I think we're pretty good on that we can do a re-education camp that's a good idea now that we're doing grabbacks oh that never ends now, coming to the park of American Revolutionary Culture grabback grabback what do we got next? marching, this will be the most extensive park we're marching too we're going to be marching you have to learn you'll see marching to nowhere but essentially we're going to be marching I hate dealing with cops and outside of this organization I would never recommend anybody try to do what we have to do because we're literally marching and protesting we're not going to win from taking a stand but typically people are going to get hurt I don't know how else to say it cops are indoctrinated from an inherently indoctrinated I'm right, I'm going to hurt them I'm fully protected and we're kind of in their turf and we're not the right color either no, yeah we can go more in depth this is about as good as it's going to get but don't be under any illusions if you haven't been yelled at before it's very uncomfortable they're going to get in your face they're going to yell and if they think you're doing something strange they're probably just going to take a picture but it's ok at that point you won't remember I haven't been tased yeah not like in a cop I haven't been tased I got one dog it'll take them a few times it'll happen, I know it will eventually woo we'll be short column give me one guy here, one guy there, one guy here now for starters one more here everyone just needs to stand out of the way get familiar with the tension we're not 100% in the military but I want you to carry yourself stand up straight, shoulders back stand like a cop or a man carry yourself you're going to stand up right we're going to go over we're going to go over face to face ok who has military experience ok so you guys know left and right face y'all get up over there just two of y'all, well this will be good ok we're going to go left face ok left face ok what happens is you're going to pivot off the ball of your right foot and the heel of your left right y'all need to watch me just watch me when you're at a tension you're going to keep your feet pointed at a 45 degree angle ok like this then you go left face that's pretty much it we'll just practice that a little bit ok then we'll do it in unison I don't think anybody's taking the big one no you don't well you stay up ok once you do the left you're going to just place your foot back at a tension heel to heel no that's the right right is left face you just crank out a right do your left face there's no need for that ok that's pretty much better you can move your right foot where it was just think of it one two steps one well yeah one two none left face everyone good tension left face you guys got no left or right I'm going down the line one at a time ok left face no heel of the left ball of the right you can make this a very sharp movement heel to heel left well that's fine maybe get your toes together there you go there you go one more time left face left face perfect good perfect one two watch my feet heel of the left ball of the right pull together left face don't overthink it try it six one two good practice good stuff pivot pivot pivot and stand oh yeah already come together it stays there this is one movement look at my feet that was close there you go we'll nail it there you go there you go there you go those are close we're going to have a very sharp identical that'll work we'll do this when we all go home left face there you go left face okay and right face is just the opposite right face is just the opposite practice that when you go home okay I don't think we need to really worry about about face but we'll go over it anyway about face is a little tricky let's do it together y'all I'll get it my first try I'm just going to watch pretty much the call will be made it'll be addressed to everyone I'm sure the main column about face bingo it's the toe of the right foot behind the heel of the left and it's another pivot all of these facing movements are pivots no not at all watch me okay when you come back heels together toes at 45 okay y'all watch don't do it just watch toe behind the left heel can you see my feet yeah exactly I did it one more time about face about face oh I see it's still a two count thing so how you doing one two one two one two about face that's how it should be let me stand in front and you call about face do it again about face about face about face about face about face listen to his claps about face about face about face about face these rocks are not really helping either but remember any time you move it's a pivot when we get to marching up the column when we do a column left you don't have room to step because you're too close to people this prevents stepping on everyone next to you exactly and then when we start marching in unison the slinky effect is in okay let's do a few more about faces get into tension get your ranks clean get a little bit of a stretch be directly in line with the guy next to you directly behind the guy in front of you about face one two about face everyone's returning at the same time about face nice about face make sure you're using your right foot not your left foot same foot every time I like it about face good okay now you guys practice this and y'all get home okay so now marching the very first thing we're going to go over y'all you guys can get back to ranks I'll tell you what five hey alright y'all guys get on the drive we're going to be following the road okay Norman you get to the right you guys have experience everyone can look to the right you're the guy right yeah so if you guys need a reference you're going to look to the man to the right of you because this is essentially column leader, section leader, seal team leader and we like to keep it on the right so first things first you guys ready I'm going to call mark time mark okay okay mark time you always step to the left first usually you keep your knees up it still looks fine you're always standing up straight left left left left make sure you're hitting on the ground when you clap that clap is your left foot touching the ground clap clap clap and you guys listen to the boots you can hear it once you get in step you can hear it left left left left okay let's do it again mark time when I say mark it's the left first watch me mark time and I forgot the call and halt anyway mark time left good left left section halt one two I'm going to make the calls on left section halt section halt section halt halt you're going to be able to pause the call one two okay now we go into half steps that was mark time that means you're stationary in one place half steps when you get your knees up and you move forward okay so watch half step march section halt okay half step march knees up go on section halt now let's try it I want you all to march to me keeping in step because we're going to start incorporating a snare drum okay so anytime you hear the snare drum I'm going to clap for the sake of this exercise it's going to be the left foot and when you start remember when you start when you start when you start when you start when you start when you start when you start when you start"

I don't really know if I would ever vote for Tulsi for anything, but I do like her. I really do. She's genuine, she's not a politician, she's a stateswoman.

Good to see you man. Alright guys, we'll jump into it. We're five minutes in. Other brothers and sisters will pop in. Yeah man, Patriot Front. I wanted to talk about them. First off, before I start showing clips and stuff. Do you guys even know who they are? I had never heard of these people until they did this march. No one really made a fuss about it except the mainstream media. Had you guys heard of Patriot Front? Supposed to be like a white supremacist group. Uh oh. You got to tell me bye. You got to tell everybody bye. Say bye. You don't see anybody's way back do you? Why you acting all shy? She smiled. I love you. Have a good day. Listen to your teacher. Merry Christmas. Why did you do that to her? I love you sweetheart. Be safe. Alright. Anyway. This is why we do it guys. This is why we prep. This is why we try to live good lives. For those little ones right there. Try to protect them from what's going on in this freaking world. Anyway. Like what's going on with Patriot Front? Anyway. I never heard of them. I had never heard of them. I didn't know what it was. If you just hear the name Patriot Front, you're like what is that? Some kind of patriotic group or something like that? It's not clear. Their intentions are not clear. For one thing. I'm going to show you guys some of the video. I'm going to show you. They did a march in Washington D.C. It was never clear why they were marching. Why they were protesting. But I'm just going to show you the clip. And you guys. As you watch it. If you haven't seen it. If you have, just bear with me. I want you to tell me what impression you get from this clip. All right. So. Just your initial impression. That's them. I saw someone say hey to hey, Layson. Good to see you, sis. Good morning. Loretta. Good morning, sis. Good to see you. Milkmaids in the house to milkmaid. What's up? I tell you what, man. All the best people are in here with us. All right. The cold ad even devout line is here this morning, guys. Wow. Devout, man. You always go to the extreme. You know that you really do. But what you said is true. I mean, look at in fact, man. Two other people shot themselves during protests. That's all I'm just like that out there. All right. So. So look at this. Look at this. Look at this. I'm just like that out there. All right. So. So look at that. I saw it. G2 was pointed out before we even showed the clip. All the khaki pants and everything. You're right, sis. And a lot of people saw this and like this is a false flag. These are feds. And one of the main glaring things is, yes, they are super well funded, man. All those same uniforms that they wear. They're commercially made flags that they use. All the things you see, because we've seen other. We see militias. Do their protests. We've seen the proud boys. We've seen the Oath Keepers, the three percenters. We've seen real like right wing racist white supremacist groups like the white nationalists. You do their tiki torch marches in 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia. But if you look at all those things, you'll notice the glaring differences. And if these people are super well funded men, whoever they are, you know, we're going to do a little investigation here today. And I just want to point out something. But I know people think this is like another FBI thing. I actually don't think they're the FBI, you know, and we'll get into the reasons why here a little bit. Ginger Snap. Good morning. But anyway, like I said, they were there. They did their march. Their their leader, their founder, Thomas Russo. We'll see him in a little bit. He gives a little speech, but I noticed something about him. They're very careful not to say certain racial things, you know. I mean, they are. They are being portrayed. If you go to the Web site, you could tell from the language that they use that they are, you know, or they're not being portrayed. But I do think this is a false flag. I think something's going on here. But anyway, let me let me show you their recruitment video. It's freaking hilarious. A lot of the things that they say in the language they use, it's almost like a far leftist. Wrote it like scripted it out like what they think, like a far right white supremacist, like a far right white supremacist, like a far right white supremacist, like a far right white supremacist militia group would say. Let's see. Check them out. Let's see. Check them out. Behind me is a new born disunicle. This is a house where America's future is but good, one who rules it. Let no man who sows disunity call himself a man. We are not a powerful nation, or a leftist, or a rightist, or a plutocratic project to be distorted once the flood is over. We demand justice. Those who speak out, calling themselves a state, are not the corporate nation. There is an anarchist book bearer inside this building. Shit, last part. Inside this building is an anarchist book bearer. Like so? I mean, you're supposed to be a white supremacist group, right? Why do you care about anarchist books? What you're doing is kind of anarchy. Not true anarchy. Anyway, when did all of that take place? Do y'all ever remember seeing these guys in any of those protests with their little parade float, burning stuff, shouting with the bullhorn? I literally have never heard of these guys until this recent march in DC. What else did you notice? Did you notice their back lavas, their face masks? They all cover their face. Most right-wing militias or white supremacist groups don't do that. And there's no uniformity. Notice how they were all young, fit men also? There are no beer bellies, no older veterans or anything that's part of their group. The normal people you would see that are part of white supremacist movements, it's very weird. It's very weird, it's very eerie. I think we're all right to recognize this for what it is. G2. Thank you, sis. Exactly. Now, I'm going to show a clip from a guy I like to watch. He has a channel called Mr. Reagan. It's a pretty good channel. He's a hardline conservative, and I'm not. A lot of his takes are just partisan. But he does have a friend who was a former FBI agent who was one of the heads of the Domestic Terrorism Division. And he showed him this video. All right, let me see. But is this an FBI operation? It's an interesting question, and one that I pose to this guy. This man is the host of the Mark Vines podcast, and a man I consider a friend. I've had him on the show before, and he's not only a great guy, but he is the guy to go to if you want to know what's going on here. He is a former FBI agent, but more importantly, he was a supervisor in the Domestic Terrorism Division. And he can let me know for sure whether or not these guys were legit militia, or if they were FBI, or what was going on here. So he happened to call me up last night, and I was working on this video. And I said, hey, I'm doing this video on this group, and I think that they might be a fake FBI organization posing as a white supremacist group. Can you watch the video and let me know what you think? So he clicks on the link, and immediately, you know, this smile flashes across his face. And like a moment later, he just bursts out laughing. Now, he had two comments. One, he said, these guys are definitely not FBI agents. And two, they are definitely not right-wing militia guys. Okay, so what the hell are they? Right? I don't think they're FBI either, because a lot of them are really young guys. And the average age of someone who enters the FBI is someone in their 30s. I have a family member who was in the FBI, and he entered in his 30s. The FBI usually looks for people who already have a college-educated skill. You know, so they don't really recruit people when they're 20, young people, people out of high school. Actually, the military is the only people who recruit people right out of high school. Like even local law enforcement, they have to be, what, at least 20 years old. But anyway, so if they're not FBI, that doesn't mean that this isn't a false flag. There are many other federal agencies also. The Justice Department itself is now an activist group. But I think it's more likely, like G2 pointed out, with their U-Hauls. They always have their U-Hauls that they get out of and bring their equipment. You guys remember a couple weeks ago, I showed that clip of that lady who directly works for Porgy Poros. You guys know who I mean. Gotta be careful saying certain names on YouTube. We want this video to go as far as possible, because I think it gets to the root of what's going on in our country. We've talked about it before. We have groups that are trying to sow division constantly along racial lines. And I don't believe there's a major threat from any white supremacist group. Even this group, there's like 100 members. Ooh, 100 people are going to overthrow the entire United States of America. Get out of here. But you notice no one's running to join these groups or anything like that. We know that there are racists. We know there's white supremacist groups. We also know they are no major threat to overthrowing this country, because the majority of us, we're not into that crap. We're against that. We're Americans. But anyway, that's what I think's happening. Here's what I think happened. Antifa, another group that is totally funded by Porgy Poros, went out all last year. And they're trying to fight the Nazis and the white supremacists. They didn't find any. So they just burned down as many black neighborhoods as they could. I know that they had fought in the past with groups like the Oath Keepers, like the Three Percenters, like the Proud Boys, who the mainstream media tried to paint as white supremacist groups. Problem is, these groups have been here for a very long time, and we know who they are. And their membership does not only include white males, especially like the Proud Boys. The chairman of the Proud Boys is a black gentleman. He's Afro-Cuban. Enrique Tarrio, 90% of his chapter are not white people. They have gay people. I think he even said they have a trans member in the Proud Boys. So I don't think they are the hardline white supremacists that they've been trying to paint as. Same thing with other groups, too, like Three Percenters and the Oath Keepers. So I think they got the bright idea, let's make our own white supremacist group. We'll fund them, and then they can go out and represent the white supremacist movement that we're trying to fight against. I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing clashes, stage-larping clashes between these two groups. Antifa shows up in their U-Hauls. Patriot Front shows up in their U-Hauls, all rented by the same people. And they come together and they fight in the streets. I really think that's what this is. I really think that's what this is. I think that some well-funded group started this, man. Everything about it rings false. It doesn't seem genuine. It seems like an act. It seems like Hollywood to me, once again. Anyway, ghetto, good morning, brother. Yeah. Everything that Antifa did over 2020, burning all these cities down, they already tried to say it was Trump supporters dressed up like that, doing that. Get out, man. Get out of here. No one believed that. No one believed it at all. One thing, Antifa is a young group, if you think about it. They're really young people out there doing all that stuff, for the most part. Devout, you are in rare form today, brother. Right. Can you imagine, man? They're out there fighting in the streets and us regular Americans are like, look at these idiots fighting each other on the same team. I was upset with the masks they were allowed to enable in the period to take away from the sims. I knew they could. Right. Yeah. Like, again, another group that always wears masks and whatnot, Antifa, and in this group, always wearing masks everywhere they go. They had a training video, too. I didn't clip it, but because it was stupid, but in their clip, they're wearing the exact same thing they are. In that, uh, in the march in D.C. So in their training video, they're in the woods, they're all alone, they're in remote area, they're still wearing masks and stuff. They're wearing masks because they don't want to be identified because they're not really white supremacists. I really believe these are like left wing activists that think, I mean, what do they think, man? They're faking a white supremacist movement. How do they think they're using their fake and white supremacy so that they can fight white supremacy? You know, so I think this is just another ploy to divide us, man. You know. Jesus. Anyway, this is the guy who's supposedly the founder of this group. His name is Thomas Rousseau. Or should listen to him. Tell me if he's not regurgitating a script that someone else wrote for him. And I want you to know he doesn't sound like like a white supremacist to me. He sounds like a leftist Marxist trying to overthrow the government. But still the language he uses. But we aren't in those times. So these days need to be calls to action. We not only seek to exchange the structures which guide modern social, philosophical, legal and political conduct. But we seek to dig to the core beliefs, the foundation of why the government is legitimate. Why it ought to be and why it should be there at all. We recognize the need for organizing and the need for a structured society. But we don't go so far as legitimizing conventional parties and conventional dynamics. Which can only yield conventional results. Which are by their very nature opposed to the revolutionary consciousness that we are making every effort to promote, to instill, to inspire. And to forge ourselves into physical blood and bone representatives of. Doesn't he seem like like what I said a Marxist activist. Notice how he started by saying our 4th of July celebrations using fireworks, eating hot dogs and stuff. He's saying that's wrong. He's trying to paint it wrong. Doesn't that sound like it Tifa to you guys? They've been attacking every American holiday for years now. They were attacking Christmas. They attack Thanksgiving. They call it a racist holiday. You know, the 4th of July. They don't want to celebrate it. They came up with something. What is it? They're trying to replace it with Juneteenth. They're trying to replace 4th of July with Juneteenth or something like that. Which is fine. Like I've always said, celebrate whatever you want to. This is America. But don't tell me not to celebrate what I want to at the same time. You know, but yeah, guys, I just I think this is a false flag. I really do. I don't know what's going on with this. But I know I bet the federal government is definitely involved. And some well-funded private person because that's how they get away with crap. Now the establishment shields. That's what they do. You know, oh, Brandon did his executive order trying to trying to force. Businesses to be his Gestapo and make their their employees get the jab. You know, and of course it backfired. The Supreme Court shot it down. This is what they do. They get other people to do their dirty work so they can no one could point at them and say, oh, look, the government, you know, is out there authoritarian. But anyway, smells like soy, right, bro? I'm down, man. I think there should be some very serious ramifications for government officials who don't do their job and don't represent their people. There should be. We really should. These treasonous acts. There have been acts of treason that have been committed, committed, gosh, Tuesday morning, have been committed by our government officials, by our politicians. And nothing's happened to him in. Look at all the treasonous acts that have happened. Look at how General Milley was contacting the. The leader of the Chinese army, the general over there behind President Trump's back. He's beating US president now, going behind his back. And sharing information with him and letting him know, like, no matter if this guy decides to go to war, I'm not going to let it happen. That is treason. That is treason. There's no ifs, ands, or buts. There was no trial, even nothing. But yeah, I think I think treason should be punishable by death. I think we should have hangings on the front of the White House lawn. And I think that would keep people in line. All these these treasonous senators and people like Ilhan Omar, you know, who makes the comment about 9-11. Some people who did something. That's how she sums up 9-11. You know, she's been caught, wrapped up and embroiled thanks to Project Veritas. We know that she was a part of the whole buying boats thing in her district. She has been an advocate for terrorists. The guy who was trying to join ISIS, she wrote a letter to the judge saying that he was just a victim of the American system. What? That's America's fault he's going to join ISIS? Come on, you know, all these treasonous acts, man. D-Val, you're on top of it, man. You should be in charge. Silent Whispers, good morning. Good to see you. You think if they were this big, we would be heard of them before. And that video is definitely made with some serious cameras from multiple angles. Definitely. It was very professional. Their website is immaculate. Like, it's a beautiful website. The content sucks, you know, like I said, there's a lot of it's racist rhetoric, but it's like underneath the surface. You can tell they're very they're very careful not to say certain racist things. You know, like they're not out there blasting the N-word or anything like that or saying the Holocaust didn't happen. But they also use language you can tell they're trying to co-opt certain patriotic terms and like the red, white and blue. They're trying to make that into a white supremacist thing. They want to put that image into our minds. It's all about dividing us, man. But look, as soon as they do this stuff, it doesn't reintroduce the racist rhetoric. It's true to us. Real patriots. Even you guys, you brothers and sisters who are in the fight with us who aren't American citizens because you're going through it in your own country. You even you see it, you know. I don't know. I'm just I'm just tired of the BS, man. You know, I'm ready for the uprising. The real one. It is punishable by death, but we never use it. You know, we never call people up like what's his name? What's the name? So well, the guy who was with Feng Feng, the Chinese spy sleeping with her. He wasn't even investigated and he wasn't even removed. He he is the head of the Intelligence Committee. Intelligence Committee sleeping with a Chinese spy. That's why I mean, we've been infiltrated by the Chinese for a long time. We really have. I mean, gosh, they've got a man in the White House now. Yeah, right. They stole it from her. That white supremacist symbol, the American flag. Right, sis. You guys could check out their website. I mean, it's it's it's a very professional website. And if you compare it to other white supremacist groups. You could see the glaring difference. You know, they're putting on an act. Man, these people aren't real. They're not serious. But we see what they're doing. We see their crap. We're not putting up with it. We're not fooled by it. They think we're stupid. That's the thing. And I think the problem is a lot of us were asleep for a long time. We just weren't paying attention. We weren't stupid. We were just distracted by living in our modern society. We live in the first world. You know, there's a lot of distractions for us out there. And the mainstream media had been infiltrated right under our noses and gone into bed with the establishment and the globalists all over the world. And that's why we didn't see what was going on. But now that we are awake, now that we are awakened, you know, we're not going to believe any crap. They can't just pull the wool over our eyes anymore. We see Hollywood for what they are, everything they put out, right, because they're a part of this program. We see everything that the establishment's doing, the rhinos and the dinos, the uniparty. We see what they're doing. The globalists trying to push us into Great Reset. We see what they're doing. The authoritarians all over the world. We see what you are doing and we're not putting up with it. We're not standing for it. And we're not believing this false narrative about a racial divide in our country. We're not going to let it divide us, man. But anyway, guys, it's like our time's up this morning. I didn't get to give you guys the update on the Ghislain trial that I got for you, but I'll do that first thing. We'll talk about it more in depth tomorrow. I appreciate all y'all coming in, man. I knew you guys would be on top of it with me. I knew that a lot of you probably had never heard of them, just like I had never heard of them before a couple of days ago. But it's because we see what we're doing and it's because we're not white supremacists. We're not out there looking for white supremacist groups to join, you know. But I appreciate all of y'all. Have a great day. All slander, brother. Have a good evening. Let's see. Man, Chad, what's up, man? Vividness. Good morning. Good to see you, man. I'm glad you're here. Always. Things going on. What's going on over there in Denmark? But yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow morning. I'll see you guys out there in the ether. You don't know how it is, man. Let's go out there. Culture. Let's change the culture and be prepared. God bless."
733,Is_Patriot_Front_a_Fed_Sting_or_a_LARP.mp4," Hello everybody, my name is Ray. Welcome to the Evangelical Dark Web. Today we are back at it. We are talking about Patriot Front. This is a, is this a Fed sting operation? Are these LARPers? Are they the real deal? That's the question we're going to be diving into. But there's also a more important question that we'll be diving into as well. And, you know, does it make a difference? And that is the, that's actually the more important question. Because I don't think Patriot Front is a group I could get behind. And I'm going to talk about that. And that's besides the question of whether they're Fed's LARPers or the real deal or not. This is just a group that doesn't really identify the correct problem. And I don't think they really have the correct solutions either. So that's what we're going to talk about. First, I do want to point out that, you know, I hope you enjoyed that Cringe Fest video I compiled for yesterday's video. And on the woke evangelicals and their foot fetishes. I hope you enjoyed that cringe. It was rough editing it. But, you know, I was the director of that cringe. And I hope I told the story in the cringiest way possible. Just for the effect of knowing how cringy these people are. And, you know, these woke evangelicals, they're the real racists. So we're going to get back to some serious stuff. We've had some levity the last few videos with Christian film reviews. We're going to have more Christian film reviews coming up because we'll be doing the Chosen this month. Going to do a video review series of that. So do not miss that. You're going to want to subscribe and spread the word maybe. And also check out evangelicaldarkweb.org. Great articles on there. I'm not the only one writing them anymore. So other people are writing good articles now. So with that said, let's dive into the Patriot Front. A lot of this comes from Gab. I posted a poll on Gab. Is Patriot Front a Fed sting? And yes, I only got 29 votes. Which is actually pretty good for a poll that I've posted on social media. I don't get that much on Twitter. Not usually. So 34% said definitely a Fed sting. That amounts to 10 votes. 9 votes at 28% said no, real deal. And then unsure, which took the plurality, was at 38%. That was 11 votes. So again, very evenly split on this question. There's a lot of mystery about whether Patriot Front is the real deal or not. Or whether they're a Fed sting operation. So let's dive into their social media and let's kind of dive into that question. But there is a more important question overarching this issue. If they were the real deal, would we even believe it? Or are we so blackpilled that any activist organization is assumed to be a Fed? That is the more important question, I feel like. Because if we're so blackpilled on the idea of activism, that we don't actually believe any organizations can be legitimate, then we therefore don't have any more grassroots organizations and activism, then they went either way. So that is the more important question. Are we so blackpilled that we can't tell what the real deal is? Because obviously there's been a lot of Fed stings in the past and they will continue in the future. So this is just the latest possible iteration. Because clearly my audience or the audience of this poll, because I used it on a hashtag, so obviously this audience is interested in Patriot Front, these 29 voters were. But again, no clear consensus on what to make of the situation. So let's actually just dive through their social media. Let's go on a social media dumpster dive. Because that's really what their social media account is. And it's a dumpster. So this is their video. It's just a drumbeat at a protest. So let's actually go to their Gab page. And if you're not on Gab, you should get on Gab. I actually think Gab definitely poses the best as far as the alternatives go. And I think I'll do a separate video on that. Because today is Monday. On Tuesday we'll be dropping a really good column on the situations and the landscape of social media. And how that could change and why it could change. We're going to be talking about that in a different video I feel. And again, Gab is kind of to me the leader of the pack in this regard. So this is Patriot Front, their social media. And all their social media pictures seem to have this filtered image of black and white. But we're going to emphasize certain colors. So they had a rally with smoke, shields. I don't know if those are actual riot shields or not. It looks like they're wearing hockey pads on their legs. Masks up top. So one of the key observations is that this group wants to conceal their identities. They also emphasized it was a relatively peaceful event. Conservative media largely dismissed this as a fed sting. They weren't giving this the time of day of any legitimacy. So again, more pictures from their march. Shields, hockey pads. Better shields in my opinion than that. And of course they're all wearing face coverings and sunglasses. And then hats. So this is a more organized attempt than what we've seen in the past. In terms of, I'm not saying they're paramilitary. Because I don't think they're that real enough to be a paramilitary. But that's just my observation. But they are trying to dress like a paramilitary. Sort of like a response to what we're seeing in Antifa. So these are some of their pictures when they're not. So let's look at their earlier pictures. Obviously some hiking. Looks like they go out into the woods. Hanging banners up across bridges in Massachusetts. In California. And again in Massachusetts. They're doing some training and that's what it kind of shows. Some stencils. Spray painting. And again, I'm not against spray painting. On top of Black Lives Matter paintings. Because I think that's what some of these pictures depict. This is in Washington. Back in Michigan. Michigan again. Looks like they're boxing. They're doing some boxing training. And I guess I'll save my comments on that later. Oregon. Arkansas. Texas. Obviously they're supposedly chapters all across the nation. Indiana. Colorado. Virginia. Again, more boxing pictures at a park. Looks like we got some more close-quartered combat in there. But obviously a lot of their images are very... I don't want to say staged. But they're definitely putting out some propaganda for their advertisement. They want people to think that they're serious. They want people to think that they're more disciplined. And they want people to think that they're also really organized. And by all accounts, the organization and the discipline are very evident. But are they disciplined because they're feds? Or are they disciplined because these people are actually taking it seriously? Now, we can debate how seriously they're actually taking it. Because again, I don't think the shield walls and the knee pads are all that serious. I don't think that the face coverings are all that serious. When it kind of looks like, to me, that they're capitulating with COVID masking guidelines. Because to me, the face coverings should be over the eyes going down. Like you're wearing a helmet for a supervillain or something like that. That, to me, is what the face coverings should look like. Not something that looks like it could be a COVID mask. That just doesn't send the message of, we support freedom. That's just my take on that. And the boxing... Maybe those weren't entirely boxing gloves. But the idea being, shouldn't they be working more on... Something more like... Okay, those are definitely boxing gloves. Shouldn't they be working more on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu? Which is a little bit more of a practical hand-to-hand combat. Than just straight up boxing. Especially since you're not going to have gloves out in the field. So again, some of this part doesn't seem very legit to me. Seems pretty sketch. And if we want to talk about their uniforms with the khakis and the boots and all that. It's not what you expect out of a group. And... Again, a lot of people were commenting on... There's not a beer gut among any of these people. They're all in relative shape. And fit males. And this was obviously commented on. And they had a pretty good response to this. The people who support Patriot Front. They had a pretty good response to this claim. And I'll give them that. However, if we look on Gab and the people that supported Patriot Front the most. Are in my opinion, the Fed accounts. Because there are a ton, allegedly. A ton, definitely. Of Fed accounts on Gab. That's definitely the worst part about Gab are the Fed accounts. They're usually like the pro-Nazi or the people that hate Jews. Hardcore on there. Often thought to be Feds. And for good reason. And those accounts seem to be the most bullish on Patriot Front. Now again, I don't think Patriot Front looks all that serious to me. I think this is a very glorified and very well organized and expensive LARP. But... It's not a LARP because they concealed their identities. It's not a LARP because they're heavily organized. It's a LARP because I don't think there's any real outcome here. I don't think they're actually serious. And let me actually read what Patriot Front actually believes. I'm going to read some excerpts from their manifesto. I can't show it on the screen. I have it pulled up on my phone. Can't show it on the screen because the website's not working on my desktop for some reason. But I had it preloaded. I was reading it earlier on my phone and that's still working. So, people without a natural identity will find an artificial one. Instead of identifying with a natural classification such as family, community, nation, or race, one will identify with a corporate brand, a materialistic political viewpoint, or a commercialized facet of culture. So, that's one excerpt. And clearly, there is a huge emphasis on your ethnicity in this group. I don't think it's a group that non-white people can really be welcomed and a part of. I don't think they'll tolerate the rooftop Korean, which is a natural ally to the white conservative. Just saying. So, I'm going to read the tail end of it. This is towards the end of their manifesto, which is really long. It really emphasizes European identity and that will be evident in the section I'm about to read. Our people must learn to internalize their natural identities and come to connect that re-emerging identity with their homeland. Americans are descendants of Europeans, but at the same time, they are not Europeans. This nation is unique in its newly realized pan-European identity, which has allowed it to succeed. A nation without its people realizing a common identity is no nation at all. I agree with that last part. If there's no identity as a nation, there really isn't a nation at all. I agree with that last part. But everything before that that I just read is really wrong. America is built off common law British tradition. It's not a pan-European... America does not have a pan-European heritage. That's just simply not true. It is primarily a heritage of British common law, British culture, English culture is what makes up and is the basis for American culture. You don't get to America without understanding events like the English Civil War. You don't get to America without understanding events like the battle with the state church and a lot of these other things that are very unique to British history that influenced the American Revolution. The English Bill of Rights, the battles with Parliament. Our system of government did take inspiration from the British as well. So, we're not a pan-European culture in terms of our national identity. America is not built off pan-European cultures, governance, or not all history. Because again, Europe has a very broad history. But if you read the documents like the Federalist and Anti-Federalist papers, they do reference a lot of history in there. But the point that I'm trying to make is that settlers were British. A lot of them were English colonists. And that is reflected in their culture. That's why we speak English in the United States. We don't have a hodgepodge of English, German, Swiss. Swiss isn't a language, but Switzerland is a country that has three recognized languages. We don't have that in the United States. And France, we don't speak French here either. And I think the only reason we have French labels on products is because those companies want to sell products in French Canada. Quebec, big deal up there I guess. So basically, that's the main gist of this organization. I don't think they have a correct diagnosis of the problem. The problem isn't that white people aren't recognizing a white identity. That's not the problem. The problem is, again, it goes back to the sin of Adam. It goes back to sin. Sin is the problem. Sin is a problem. I do not believe that Patriot Front addresses this issue because I believe they are largely secular. Because as you said, natural identity did not include faith. It did not include faith. So it's very clear that this is a secular attempt at saving America at best. At best, that's what it is. At worst, it is a federally created white supremacist organization. That's the at worst. Obviously, I think it's somewhere a little bit in between. Again, I don't think they're the real deal. Again, on the optimistic side, they're glorified LARPers. On the pessimistic side, they're just feds. This isn't the real deal. They're not serious. So I can't see a Christian really supporting this organization because I don't think they have a biblical worldview whatsoever. It's not in their documents. To me, I think a lot of these organizations are simply just going to steal parts of what the Bible says to point out problems and solutions. But they're going to ignore the Jesus factor because that hurts them. They don't want to confront their own sin. They don't want to confront mankind's fallen nature. They would much rather blame it on a lack of national identity. They think if we are naturally good and if we just accept our natural identity, everything will be all good again. That's not how human nature works. So, again, I'm not a fan of Patriot Front. I don't think that they're the real deal. It's not necessarily proven that they're feds either. They could just be glorified LARPers that are sinking a lot of money into their devotion to their live action role play. That could be it. But I don't think conservative media is wrong to decry them and denounce them as a fed operation. And back to the question I think is more important. Would we recognize real activism if it showed up the next day? Or are we just so trained and accustomed to believing that these are all feds? That they're just going to entrap us in a crime, in a conspiracy? That, to me, is the more dangerous and pressing question. Again, Patriot Front, not the answer. But what could be the answer? I don't think it's the 3%ers or the Oath Keepers. I believe the feds really hardcore infiltrated both of those. But there are other groups out there. But again, a lot of them are LARPers as well. They're not serious. So that's really all I've got to say about that. My name is Ray. This is the Evangelical Dark Web. If you like this kind of content, subscribe to the channel as well. Also check out EvangelicalDarkWeb.org. That'll be linked in the description below. Have a blessed day. And don't forget to leave a comment.

We've got to be missing one. You know what they may be relying on? James, where would you put one? I don't know, maybe in a light pole or. There's no way there's only two. Have we considered one across the street? Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, like over that way. Yeah, if they can reach that far. It looks like, I wonder if those were there before or if those are there for that particular reason. Can we disarm them? It's possible they've been there for a while. Can we disarm them and if they do get cut, does it trigger a response to the police station? Well, I mean, I think if everybody's, you know, wearing what they're supposed to be wearing. It wouldn't matter. It wouldn't matter, you don't, you know, park around. One thing I did notice was it looks like they're probably hooked up to the same thing everything else is over there. In this case, that's exposed. You can literally just unplug it. Where's that at? On the other side of that mosquito wall. Yeah, I wanted to see how loud that could be. It literally doesn't matter what I have to hold on to. You don't need to wire it. It's obvious it's coming back to you. I was listening to that for the last time. It's probably right there.

735,Joe_Rogan_on_PF.mp4," You're telling me the FBI is not monitoring fringe groups and they're not aware these people are this fucking organized? Out of nowhere they pop out with the same size flags and the same outfit on, goose stepping. They're walking, not goose stepping, but you know, walking at the same pace in a fucking orderly line. Like who organized this? This is them on their bus. I was trying to, I thought this was going to turn into the video of them walking. See the video of them walking. Is that the video of them walking? These are linking to blog posts. God, there's got to be a video of them walking. I know I've watched it. So here's it. Uniformed white nationalist group marches on Lincoln Memorial. CNN's all in. They're like, we're all in on this. Come on, show us. Look at these guys. Look at these guys. Where's the fat people? How come they're all wearing the same clothes? Do that again. What the fuck is this? Is that, have you ever seen anything that looks more like feds? Tell me that doesn't look like feds. Right? It's like the 101st Airborne. Bro, look at this. These guys are all runners. These guys look like they just got out of buds. I mean, what the fuck out of here? They could be real. Right? They could be real. They could be real. Listen, Matt Taibbi, I'm an unreliable source and I'm a comedian, but looking at that, I'm calling bullshit. Give me that again. Give me that again. Yeah, okay. Well, this gets back to like the Oklahoma Ivermectin story where you're all wearing winter coats. Yeah, like, you know, look at this. The fuck out of here. How do they all have like uniformed outfits on? They have the same color pants for the most part. Very little variation. They have tan or brown pants, dark blue shirts with a fucking stupid flag on it. This asshole's got a drum. Back that up. Look at the fucking drum. Bitch, are you Paul Revere? What the fuck are you doing with that drum? He's walking around with a band drum. Like a high school drum line. This is so stupid. It hurts my feelings. They all have flags. Keep that up there. We need to find. There's videos from them from like July. But I'd like to see that again. So you know what's so interesting about this though? Is that again? Okay, I just need to see it. Go ahead. Tell me. So look at this. I mean, maybe they're real. Maybe they're real. Could be real, but I'm calling bullshit. They have the same fucking size flags, the same white coloring on their face, the same tan hats on. Get the fuck out of here. And why are they wearing masks by the way? Like because they're cowards, right? Or they're feds. Yeah, like right? Yes."
736,"Kim_Iversen_Joe_Rogan_Calls_BS_On_Patriot_Front_March,_Is_The_Group_Backed_By_Feds.mp4"," What's on your radar, Kim? Well, Joe Rogan is questioning whether or not the white nationalist group Patriot Front is real or another FBI operation. Uniformed white nationalist group marches on Lincoln Memorial. CNN's all in. They're like, we're all in on this. Come on, show us. Look at these guys! Look at these guys! Where's the fat people? How come they're all wearing the same clothes? Do that again. What the f*** is this? Is that, have you ever seen anything that looks more like feds? Tell me that doesn't look like feds. Right? It's like the 101st Airborne. Bro, look at this! These guys are all runners! These guys look like they just got out of Buds. I mean, look. Get the f*** out of here. They could be real. Right, they could be real. They could be real. Listen, Matt Taibbi, I'm an unreliable source and I'm a comedian. But looking at that, I'm calling bulls***. Give me that again. Give me that again. Uh, yeah, okay. Well, this gets back to the Oklahoma Ivermectin story where you, you know. Right, where they're all wearing winter coats. Yeah, like you, you know. Look at this! The f*** out of here. How do they all have, like, uniformed outfits on? They have the same color pants for the most part. Very little variation. They have tan or brown pants. Dark blue shirts with a f*** stupid flag on it. This b*** got a drum! Back that up! Look at the f*** drum! B*** are you Paul Revere? What the f*** are you doing with that drum? He's walking around with a band drum. It's a high school drum line. This is so stupid it hurts my feelings. Well, the march Rogan is referring to happened this past Saturday, December 4th in Washington, D.C. There were about 100 to 200 demonstrators. They all wore matching jackets, khaki pants, carried flags or shields, and seemed fairly organized, marching to the beat of a snare drum. Because they were so seemingly organized, others besides Rogan wondered the same thing. Comedian and author Tim Young wondered, was today's Patriot Front parade just the FBI spending their end-of-year use-it-or-lose-it budget? Host Mr. Reagan tweeted, So this made me curious. I'd never heard of this group, and I wanted to dig deeper. Who are they and what are they about? Could it be that Joe Rogan's suspicions are right and this is an FBI operation? Or is this group very real and a genuine growing threat? Or is this group real and not really a growing threat, but one that can easily be ignored instead? Well, it turns out the group began in 2017 after the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally that resulted in the murder of Heather Heyer. That rally was organized by a group called Vanguard America. But apparently, after the chaos and violence, there was some infighting between the main leader of the group and one of his underlings. Ultimately, the underling, Thomas Rousseau, who was 18 at the time, decided to leave Vanguard America because of the violence and start his own group that he called Patriot Front. So the group is decidedly nonviolent, but they do believe that the country should be run exclusively by people of European ancestry. They do think people from different places and backgrounds can live in America, and they state they believe they can even be good citizens, but they should not be considered Americans nor make decisions for the country. They spend a lot of time talking about the corruption of our government and how bought off they are by corporations. They are very anti-drug. None of their members can use substances. They say the Americas were conquered by the colonizers, not stolen, and seem to be very proud of this. They say they believe in revolution and resisting tyranny, but I haven't seen any photos of any of them with any firearms or weapons. In fact, the worst thing this group seems to do is hang posters advertising themselves and tagging buildings with their slogans. What stands out about this group and where one could come to the conclusion that this really is an FBI operation is how polished and organized they are. First of all, their website is extremely professional with well-done graphics, professional photos, and even a cinematic video trailer. It's almost too professional. Their social media posts are uniform and look like they're managed by a social media expert. Everything is color-coordinated and themed. Even their graffiti is done with stencils. Their manifesto sounds like it's read by a professional voice actor. Nothing is sloppy. Snooping around their social media posts, you'll see videos and photos of the members who are relatively young, looking, participating in boot camp-style athletic drills and doing boxing workouts. They go on hikes and excursions, and they always, always wear matching uniforms and white face coverings. They've held several marches around the country similar to the one held in D.C. They've held these marches in places such as Philadelphia, Salt Lake, Nashville, and San Antonio. And when looking to sign up for the group, the form explicitly asks the members to never divulge any information that would identify themselves. They protect their identities from the organization and from each other. So I'm not going to lie. Between their website, social media posts, cinematic trailer and manifesto, and their organized marches, it's really hard to believe that some 18-year-old kid did all of this. How would some kid even know how to put on boot-style camp drills and keep the group organized? It looks like the work of someone who ran military units. What makes me skeptical of this being some sort of FBI operation attempting to root out white nationalists is because it's a very nonviolent group. When posting about their marches, they always highlight that they were peaceful and conducted safely. They seek police escorts, and in one instance, when counter-protesters engaged them, they ended their march to avoid any sort of violent conflict. One would think if this group is part of some sort of FBI operation, they would be attempting to engage in violence or illegal activity of some sort. For years, the FBI has run sting operations within the Muslim community in an attempt to root out terrorists. They would infiltrate Muslim communities, and once a person is deemed a suspect, the FBI would run a sting operation and often supply everything that was needed. For example, in 2009, a group of four Muslim men, known as the Newberg Four, were charged with plotting to bomb two Jewish synagogues and shoot missiles at military supply planes. However, it turns out there was an FBI informant among them who basically schemed the whole thing and roped these men into it for money. He suggested the plot and the targets, bought the gun, provided the fake bombs and missile, assembled the explosive devices, and drove them around. The Fort Dix Five was another FBI-planned plot to attack New Jersey Army Base Fort Dix. The FBI informants plotted everything and supplied the weapons. The men who were convicted were really only guilty of being Muslim and expressing their disgust with the American wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. But nonetheless, the country had an appetite to find and stop terrorists, and so overzealous law enforcement went to work. With the growing narrative of far-right white nationalists and Trump supporters being the country's greatest threat, we've seen the same FBI entrapment tactics being used. The attempted kidnapping of Governor Gretchen Whitmer is one recent example where it was discovered that at least 12 undercover informants played major roles in the scheme. The Biden administration and Democrats in general are bent on selling this threat to the American public, so it makes sense why so many would be suspicious about whether or not organizations such as Patriot Front are actually real. So I can't say whether or not they are, but I can say from looking through their sites and watching their videos that if they are supported by someone unidentified, it's likely someone with military training and definitely someone with money. So I'm curious if you guys think kind of looking at all of this, I mean look, these kids, they have shields like the police style riot shields, and they're painted in red, white, and blue, and they all have uniforms, they have training camps. It's just, there's clearly money behind this group. There's not very many of them. This group is small. It's only a few hundred people maybe around the country. I'm curious if you think looking at this, do you think this is possibly an FBI operation, or do you think this is real? I mean the fact they came into U-Hauls is extremely suspicious. None of them had trucks. So basically if you were going to be the FBI, or some agency, probably the FBI, and you were going to organize something like this, all of the boxes that you would check are being checked here. It doesn't mean that that's what happened, but that's really like not carrying weapons, not engaging the protesters in any type of violence that could escalate, because those would be rules of engagement that as a law enforcement person you're not supposed to do. Showing up in a U-Haul, because if you show up in, or a rented van, because if you show up in your own, then people can figure that out and trace it back. Like all of these things, plus Rogan's like, it just doesn't scan type of thing. And to say that these may be feds is not to discredit the idea that there is a problem with white supremacist militias around the country. People should not take that away from that point. The feds infiltrated and propped up all sorts of left-wing socialist and civil rights groups in the 50s and the 60s, which does not mean that there were not organic, real civil rights and socialist organizations. It just means that this is what the feds do. Yeah, and you could say the same thing about what the feds were doing throughout the aughts when they were infiltrating mosques, etc., etc., which by the way, interestingly- Right, it's of course the case that there are terrorists that exist in the world. But also it is the case that the feds gin up stuff because they're no good at their jobs. So they have to fake things so that they can then trick idiots into giving them a press conference. And that's the parallel with what we know about the Whitmer plot. That is really interesting. It's very unfortunate for the FBI that that was so easy to sort of unravel. And similarly, this one is looking like when you have these glaring red flags, like U-Hauls and uniforms, etc., it's making it really easy to identify. And there's a question of whether they're that dumb. It's an open question. But I would say it's possible that like the Whitmer plot, it's a combination of both. And that you have somebody who is putting these ideas in the ears of people like, hey, we should do U-Hauls. And there are sincerely people in this group that believe the noxious things that the group purports to believe. And then the last thing I'll add is one thing that's alarming to me is how in sync a lot of wealthy establishment people in this country with money are with the feds now. And it is entirely possible to me that they would put money behind this just on their own. If you look at MSNBC, I mean, it's full of feds. And like the Lincoln Project types love these types of people. And so I could just see that happening without the feds even needing to at this point actually nudge it along. Yeah, I mean, the big question is how big of a threat are these things really, though? So yes, do these things exist? Yes, do terrorists exist in all forms? Yes. But how large of a threat? What are we, the American people, willing to give up or willing to do to others in order to root out that threat? So something like this, a group like this, they're going around the country, they're doing these marches, they're wearing these white masks that are kind of reminiscent of white hoods. So it kind of gives you that visual of, oh, my gosh, these are, you know, they're organized, they're marching with these flags and these shields and they're scary, they're covered with these white masks. And the optics of it is very frightening for people to see this happening at the nation's capital or in Philadelphia or in Salt Lake City or in Nashville, you know, all around the country. The optics of it are very, very scary. So, but, you know, look, I grew up in Idaho. I have to say we had actual white supremacist camps in Idaho. They had parades every year. They were allowed to have those parades. The ACLU fought on their behalf to have those parades. They were nonviolent. We ignored them. I never saw a single one of those parades. I never ran into a single one of them. I mean, even though those camps existed, they're no longer there. But even though that existed where I grew up, it was literally, I mean, it was just no threat to us. It was, they could be ignored. And this is the kind of group that if it is real and not some sort of FBI operation, I mean, I just think they're not a real threat. They're not doing anything. They've got wacky ideas that are really backwards that the vast majority of America are not going to agree with. There's no threat of this ideology growing inside of the American public. Even on the right, they're not going to agree that no, America should just be European. I just don't think they're a threat at all. It's just not a real threat. I do think that, I do think the ideology is a real thing, but I do think this particular group was fabricated. So you're believing that it's, you think it's fake. Those particular clowns I kind of do. It's very, very polished. It might not be, I don't know, but it just doesn't, smells off. Rogan and Tayibi, great combination though. I haven't listened to it yet. That was fun. Anyway, we will have more Rising right after this."

741,Marching_2.mp4," If you start marching, start with the left. It always starts with the left. Okay, now watch how I march to me. Keeping in step, listening for the drums, listening to everyone's boots. Okay? Um, march! Perfect, nice! Watch it. Section, halt. That was beautiful, guys. About face. No, no, no, go back. Go on about face, y'all. Alright, section about face. Nice! Half step, march! Nice! Half step, march! Left, left, left, left, left. Get in step. Left, left, left, left. Fix yourself. Left, left, left, left. All the way around. Left, left, left. James Floyd, Logan, and halt. Alright, get in your ranks. Well, they just kept skipping. If you get out of step, you're skipping. And you need to be dressing to the guy on your right. So what that means is my peripheral vision, I'm matching this guy. That means that if you start drifting or doing something weird, he starts drifting, it gets worse the further it goes. So our spacing is dictated by the person on our right. That includes turning on the road. So if we start getting, dragging out into a curved shape, that's not it. You stay very tight. So if you notice something drifting, take a little bit longer step. And like he's saying, to get in step, you can skip to get that foot on the ground. It's not that hard, but just keep it in mind. Auditory, you're going to hear it. You're going to see it. Alright. I want you in the bow face. Dress up to the right. And we're going to be following the road. I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. Let me get over here. I'll tell you what, I'll march with y'all. Just in case y'all need to see. You could do like an element lead. That's what I'll do. I'm going to go, I'm going to just go center. Alright. Section. Half time. March. Alright. Right half. Left half. Left half. Left half. Section. How'd that look, Normandy in step? Yeah, pretty good. You should be ending in a line as well. I'm going to do an about face. We'll do that one more time, then we'll get into the regular section. Section, about face. I like it. Alright. There you go. Alright. Oh no, we're not going to work. This is not the military. But it's still alright. Okay. Half step. March. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left half. You all got to get to the end of the straight line. Remember, the man on the right at the end is going to be your job. So now, that was half step. Marching is the same thing. You're just walking, but you're walking in steps. Forward march, you read the call. Okay. Let's do an about face. We'll go the other way. Now forward march is the same. You're just going to pretty much just walk in. But you're going to stand up straight, and you're going to look crisp and clean. Right. Speed's not equal around a curve, which is screwing somebody all up. You've got to match the move. Our paces may be different depending on our size, but our legs. So as you see the shape move, it's the angle that catches the curve of this. Okay. And it moves in cohesion, so everybody's speed isn't identical. Yeah, it'll make sense once you go the whole way. But now, it's the same thing, you're just not doing a half step. You're just marching like a crisp and clean. Forward march. Left. Left. Left. I would just demonstrate. But it's okay. You're going to have to go down. Yeah, please. Yeah, it would be. Okay. I'm going to stay in front of you all, so you're all going to kind of get eyes. Okay. Forward march. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left, huh. Okay, good. Stop face. Forward march. Left. Left. Left. Left. Oh, speed up. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. March in 300. And halt. Okay. Now face. Dress it up. Look at my toes. Keep it with a steady, singular pike. Back. Back. You don't want to get so close to the step. You're on it. This is usually the distance. Just barely be able to touch him. Standard stride. Standard stride, the step. And remember, these are guided. You can peek out too. Make sure you're in line. You're still just a tad forward. This is fine. You are keeping arms straight down with the motion, right? Yeah, you're crisp and clean. I'm not getting too militant about it. Look crisp and clean. No slouching. Okay. Stand up. Pull together. Forward march. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. And halt. Do it again. About face. Forward march. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. You shouldn't get any closer than one speed. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. I'll go left and call them right because that will help for y'all's turns. Okay? Let's go over here. I heard a marching band. This is strong. All ex-military. Hey. All ex-military on me. Careful. Careful. Guys, remember, call them left and call them right. I will go on the outside, Sean. I think you're on top of this. Yeah, I'm pressing on it. Y'all get close. We're going to go to the gate. I will show you. It's going to be right here. We're turning into this grass. This is where we... We're getting along. Okay. Forward march. Call them left. You got to... Whoever's at the end has to step it out. Come back. Okay. Whoever's right here on the inside, call them left. You got to pivot, and that's where we're facing. We're going to pivot on the ball of your foot. Okay. Call them... Inside man. This is the inside man. This is what he does. He just kind of marks time and lets the rest of the column catch up. Then the second man next to the inside man is going to... It's going to be two pivots, two small pivots, and he'll half-step. Then the third man, it'll be another two pivots, and he'll just do a normal stride. Now the man on the end really has to step it out. You're moving like this. The man on the end when it's column left, march, column left, march, he's going to be stepping it out. You guys got this. You guys got this, okay? Come on. Back up a little bit so we can just take this one. Okay. For march, column left, march. Okay. March. That's when you track to the right and you keep walking. As they make the turn, the inside man will be looking by so he's not getting ahead of the other one. Okay? Look at him. He's going to step it out. Look at his hands there. You're on the bonus time. Got it? You guys really just got it. That's right. Okay, back up a little bit. Take a step back. Forward, march. Column left, march. There you go. The more times we do this, if you're looking left and right at the other man, he's going to know when to advance. Because after you make that turn, you're going to anticipate advancing. You're going to anticipate that. So if you're looking at the corner of your eye to the man next to you, you're keeping your column straight, you'll know when to keep going. Let's do that one more time. Let's clean that up. Look left, look right, look at the man next to you. Let me get on the end. Take the inside. Let me get on the end. Forward, march. Column left, march. Okay. Anticipate. Look to the man on the right and anticipate the advance. Okay? Let's do it again. You all see what I did on the end? The man on the outside really got to step it out. Go to that framework and go forward. And you're not necessarily just marking time. You've got to be aware of the man next to you. If you've got to inch forward a little bit, then you've got to be aware of that. That's where the awareness comes in. Nice and easy. Forward, march. Column left, march. Better. I was a little early there, Jesse, but that was better. And this alone, it's not going to be perfect. You guys are just learning it. But I... Okay. Let me get a... Let me get four. This actually, this... Five. Let me get five guys. You want the guys that haven't done it? Yeah, I've already done it. Call in. Now, remember, remember these calls are going to be made on the left foot. Okay? And remember, you're going to pivot off the right. Okay? Anytime you change direction, you pivot. Good. Okay? Let's go. Let's go through it. All right? You got to stand straight on that foot. There you go. Okay. Forward, march. Left. Column left, march. Are we all paying attention at all? Come back. Come on. Let me just get five. And we'll cycle out. Just for the... All right. Come back. Remember, remember, you're going to pivot off the right. So we're going to be pretty much more tight. And you'll be doing somewhat of a handstand on that face. You got to step it out. You just have a drink of water. All right? Okay. Forward, march. Column left, march. Pivot. Okay? All right. Get back. Remember, look left, look right. Be aware of the hand that you're going to face. You do when you make that turn. Okay. Y'all make that turn. Okay. Inside land. Column left, march. Pivot. And you're going to be doing this. You might not want to catch up to me, right? It's fluid. It can be set piece, but this is fluid. It's just like this. Column left, march. Pivot. Okay. Middle guy. Got a normal stride. Okay. We already told you guys about the pivot. So when you pivot, it's not this. Whatever the fuck that is. You're really going to step. Pivot like that. So if I'm walking, it's like so. And you may do three or four of those. You don't have to be nervous. You will feel the sharpness of the rhythmic movement. If you're on the outside, column left, march. Column left, march. One, two. You got it, man. Column left, march. One, two. Okay, let's try it again. Forward, march. Column left, march. Pivot. There you go, boy. Better. You got to step it out. Keep going. And once you get back in line, it's like getting on with your man. I need more effort, man. You look like you're going for the pole. I need more. Okay. Line back up."
742,Marching_3.MP4," You're going to put your foot where their foot was. Remember, it's always marching in line, right? The one right off the other band. Band. Band. Do we have to start going vertical line right now? We'll go through it one more time so I can watch. John, you call the movement. Everything's on the left foot. Follow my foot. The left. Jesse, I guess it would be us three. Ankles, cuff marks. Whenever you're all ready. Yeah, we're getting ready. Do a four degree, and some players. We have ourselves set up. It's a beautiful day today. Right. Whenever you're all ready. I don't need any shots of these guys, but it's coming. Ha ha. Oh no, get it. Yeah. Send it straight to Thomas. Don't want you to be able to talk crap with the ones that are faster than me. Ha ha ha. That's still pretty clean. Is that a 936? Yeah. 37? I'll be proud of that. I like the color. That's pretty. That's probably good. That had nothing on it. I think that was like my best shot. I think it was like a 936. It was a long shot. It wasn't there. Three miles or long? Three miles. Three cents. All right, let's go. Four miles. Actually, just watch this bit real quick. We're going to go cycle through the inside man and the outside man. So you guys can remember. Vertical. Vertical here. Vertical. We're going to be inside. Everyone pay attention, please. Sean, you're okay. You sure? If you can march, march. I'll try. Okay. All right, 10-hut. Forward march. Sorry. Bottom left. March.

You want one seat left? I want us in the front, the veterans in the front. People that are familiar. If you want to get on the end. Hey Floyd, your hat. Your hat. All the movement. You're so into it. Yeah. How many have we got? We've got a fourth guy right here. Pop up here. And that's four right here. Let's just do it like that because that's what we're doing. It'll be a fun fight. Oh yeah. The other way. Up front and forward. Yeah, you get between me and Norman. Remember, lead with the left foot, okay? Whenever you're ready, Sean. And of course, we'll follow the road. Forward march.

746,Michael_Knowles-Viral_Patriot_Front_March_REACTION-720p-.mp4," There was a very scary insurrectionist, nation-threatening march in Washington, D.C. over the weekend. You might have seen it trending on Twitter. This was the march of the Patriot Front, so-called, a group allegedly of fascists and white supremacists. And they marched through D.C. and the media, oh, they had a field day and they said, this is the white supremacist takeover of America, and you can't really see who any of these people are. And they're wearing masks and they're marching, and they've got flags. Some of the flags are upside down to signal distress. My first reaction was that this was Fed Picnic Part 2. You know, do you remember there was the justice for January 6th rally and the only people who showed up were feds and media? And like one right-wing dude who didn't get the memo that it was all fake. And so, that was my first reaction was, look, I'm on the American right. I spend a lot of time in the American right. I've been in it for a long time. I'm familiar with lots of fringe groups, okay, even the ones that are way out there. I'm at least familiar with them. I've never heard of this group. Have you, the Patriot Front of the white supremacist national whatever? No. So was it a Fed thing or what, or is it real? I don't know. Maybe it's real. Even assuming for a second that this is a real group and there aren't any feds and it's not fake and not just a media contrivance. Ask yourself this, what poses a bigger risk to you? A bunch of clowns marching through the streets, not harming anybody, making a big show and giving the media a circus, but not burning down any stores or killing people or assaulting people and just kind of marching around and going home, probably back to Quantico or Langley or something, but whatever. Does that pose the bigger threat to you or does, say, BLM and Antifa with the support of the entire media and elected Democrats for six months burning down the country, does that pose the bigger threat? What's the real threat here? The real threat is according to the establishment, BLM, which killed dozens of people and torched cities around the country and stole a lot of Gucci handbags, BLM was mostly peaceful. And according to the media, those guys whose identities we don't know conveniently, those guys marching peacefully for a few hours, they are an insurrectionist threat to destroy the country. Obviously, the narrative seems a little bit backward. Hold up. I'm glad you liked that clip. Before you do anything, nope, before you even think, ring that bell. Ring it, please. Thank you.

747,Michael_Ohio_Speech_10-30.MP4," All right, let's go on. I've been a member of Patriot Front for a little over a year now. Since joining, I have come to realize that it was one of the best decisions I have made in my entire life. Despite not even knowing their real names, I consider many in my network my closest friends. Our shared experiences have made them closer than family. The brotherhood I have found in PF is very much what I'd hoped for in the military. There is nothing else to be found that is like it. And it is this brotherhood that has solved a problem I did not even realize I had. Prior to joining PF, like many, I was a nationalist without a nation. I spent a great amount of time only admiring figures and movements from overseas. I found my feeling of identity in cultures from societies that are now history. While these things do have merit and honor, they should only exist as guidance, not what you dedicate all your pride to, as they are long gone. It is especially easy to do this when we are told that the identity we are born to is defined by everything except us. We are told American means a great progressive experiment of multiracialism. They used to tell us that anyone can be American so long as they believe in the Constitution. But now that part has dropped as well. We are shown that America means every expression of a culture through music or media must be about disgusting sexual acts, flexing of wealth, or celebration of crime. Then we see that America means exporting these values to the rest of the world and forcibly occupying those who do not comply. We are told to ditch our national identity in favor of whatever product is in season. We are told that this is what America has always been, but also to hate what America used to be. The truth is that these ideals have never been the historical or even current authentic image of America. The identity of our nation is not tied to our current or even historical state leaders. It is defined by the character of the average American. It is very clear that the average American, despite the cultural or political differences of his time, would undoubtedly stand with us today. American has always meant struggle and conquest. Indeed, we must not have shame for being separated from Europe by sea, because our American identity is founded in the greatest and purest form of European character, through fearless conquest and brilliant strategy, that can only come from a European mind. Our identity is not a breaking away from European character, but it is forged in the victory of European nature. It is the men here that have made me realize this. The men who have diligently planned and attended activism. The men who have fearlessly risked everything they have in their life to defend our people when nobody else will. The men who have stood tall and proudly walked streets from Chicago to Philadelphia, that are now as foreign and dangerous to us as this land was when our fathers first came to it. It is the men here that have made me stop wishing that I could have been born in a different era to fight, and instead I am now thankful for this struggle and who I share it with. It is the few young men here today that have come to embody American identity, and it is these men who have the sole right to this identity from our forefathers. We are the only ones who have a right to claim this nation as ours, and no other has the ability to take this precious identity away from us. And so I ask you now, do you give a tumor the honor of the heart? There is no reason to let a parasite, draining the soul of our nation, define it for us. Indeed, we must face this disease head on and excise it with our own hands. Just as our forefathers faced a savage land to conquer, we face a savage beast to slay. Just as our forefathers faced a war against all odds, we must throw ourselves into this battle without fear of our own destiny, but with that of our sons. It is our duty to find and perfect every means within ourselves to achieve victory against this disgusting creature that now holds our people hostage. It is not enough to simply participate as an actor playing out a script written by someone else. Our numbers are so few that we must always seek and forge new tactics in this fatal war. It is our duty because the fate of our people is on the line. You see our people, white Americans, in a completely miserable and broken state every day. These are great people with great potential that have been turned into slaves, and it is your duty to free them. There is nobody else that can come in and save us, nobody else to shirk our responsibilities to, only you and your brothers. You have been passed the torch from your forefathers. You must decide whether you will let it go dim and dark, or stoke it into a great blaze that will guide those worthy of it and scorch those who attack it. Hail Victory! Hail Victory!"

So what's the smallest unit of shield? Shield. That's the shield team. Shield team. How many are in each team? Five. Five per team. And then five plus five is a... The whole... The rear guard or the van guard? The rear guard is the rear guard. Then you have leaders for each guard. Okay. Do they have a set size for rear or van or is it just going to be five-man teams? Five-man teams. The ratio varies depending on the amount of people in the column. So flexible. We're working on all this, right? Yeah. The learning curve for the whole ward. Okay. But anyway, so we're all... It looks fine, right? Yeah."
749,MSNBC_Dana_Milbank_Reporters_Should_Be_Partisan_When_It_Comes_To_Democracy.mp4," Good evening, everyone. We begin the readout tonight with some scenes from Washington, D.C. this weekend. You're looking at a group of more than 100 white supremacists called the Patriot Front who marched around outside the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday night. Their goal, they say, is to reclaim America on behalf of their white ancestors. And according to the Anti-Defamation League, they openly define themselves as fascists. Now, if they seem familiar, that's because they were among the extremist groups at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, though they changed their name after one of their members murdered Heather Heyer with his car. Of course, their extremist views and ridiculous plastic shields earned them lots and lots of mockery this weekend, especially when several were awkwardly left stranded at the Arlington Memorial Bridge because their U-call wasn't large enough to carry them all home. Indeed, they look, OK, really stupid and it's easy to laugh at them. But to do so would be to underestimate them and the millions like them whose radical ideas are on the ascent in this country. Let's not forget the many who laughed at Donald Trump back in 2016 and even after he was elected. Thanks to four years of Trump, this country is now a backsliding democracy, according to an international think tank. And that is no joke. The truth is, this country doesn't have a great track record of recognizing authoritarians for what they are, at least not until it's too late. According to Smithsonian magazine, Benito Mussolini was a darling of the American press and American papers credited Italian fascism with saving Italy from the far left and revitalizing its economy. Similarly, Adolf Hitler was dismissed as a joke, a nonsensical screecher of wild words, according to Newsweek at the time. American press outlets predicted Hitler would be outplayed by more traditional politicians or would become more moderate. In other words, they got it wrong, badly wrong. Now fast forward to the current day and we're seeing a similar pattern emerge when it comes to the threat of Trump's big lie. As Barton Gelman warns in The Atlantic, state Republican operatives have been building an apparatus of election theft under our very noses. He notes that if the plot succeeds, the ballots cast by American voters will not decide the presidency in 2024. Thousands of votes will be thrown away or millions to produce the required effect. The winner will be declared the loser. The loser will be certified president elect. That would be the end of democracy as we know it. This American experiment with multiracial democracy, well, that will be over. And yet for much of the media in this country, it's been business as usual, despite that looming threat. As columnist Dana Milbank writes in The Washington Post, too many journalists are caught in a mindless neutrality between democracy and its saboteurs between fact and fiction. It's time to take a stand. For his column, Milbank actually hired a data analytics company to measure and compare media sentiment toward President Biden and toward Donald Trump. He found that Biden's press for the last four months has been as bad as and for a time even worse than the coverage that Trump received for the same four months of 2020. Not only that, but Trump got roughly twice as much coverage in 2020 as Biden has received in all of 2021 so far. Milbank notes that the country is in an existential struggle between self-governance and an authoritarian alternative. And we in the news media collectively have given equal, if not slightly more favorable treatment to the authoritarians. Dana Milbank joins me along with Jason Johnson, professor of journalism and politics at Morgan State University and host of the Slate podcast Award with Jason Johnson, along with Nancy McLean, historian and author of Democracy in Chains, the deep history of the radical rights stealth plan for America. Dana, I am going to start with you because I noticed that the response to many media beltway media people to your piece was to fight with you about being mean to their particular media entity. Right. You had people from Politico yelling at you on Twitter saying you said mean things about Politico. And it's like, that's not the point. And I feel like you kept trying to make the point that this isn't about, you know, saying mean things about one media outlet's coverage. It's literally the overall impact of their coverage. You wrote Biden is attempting to salvage democratic norms. The people opposing him are using fascist tools of deception and voter disenfranchisement. Neutrality in the struggle is not a virtue. I hear heared you and high five you on Twitter. I just want to let you go. Talk about what you've seen from the inside of what this media is doing, in your view, that's helping authoritarianism thrive. Yeah, Joy, I and I certainly didn't mean to suggest that it's a problem of one outlet or another or this one's better than that. Sure, some are better than others, but that's not the point. This is I mean, think about it. Comparing the form of last four months to the four months of 2020, when Donald Trump was threatening to not honor the results of a free and fair election and then ultimately didn't honor the results of a free and fair election. He was embracing the Proud Boys, white supremacists. He was embracing QAnon. I mean, he was sabotaging the post office. So this is and at that period of time, he got similar to even more favorable coverage than Biden is getting today. So I think that's astonishing. And look, people in my business, I and I support this notion. We like conflict. We're combative. We like to hold the powerful to account. But we're in a whole different game here. It's not Democrats against Republicans. It's small d Democrats against authoritarians. And as you note at the beginning, in many ways, we're losing the struggle. So I agree with reporters not being partisan, but we should be partisan when it comes to democracy. We should be partisan when it comes to the facts. And I think that's where I think we need to take a stand. Right. And, you know, Jason, you know, I've long said that the media is only real bias, at least the mainstream media is toward change and conflict. Right. Donald Trump was entertaining for a lot of Beltway journalists. He was also open. He gave lots of leaks. His administration gave you lots of data and lots of sort of conflict driven, you know, content. He was a content creator. And so there there was a you know, whereas when I remember when Barack Obama was in, the media generally disliked the Obama administration, even though they were not doing anything dangerous. He couldn't even wear a tan suit. The media would go ballistic and go nuts over him because he wasn't accessible, because he was seen as cold and not really accessible. There was no access. My challenge here and this goes all the way back to the way the media operate in the 20s with Mussolini is that the media underplays the danger when a political party is out of step with democratic norms and they overstate the horror when a Democrat generally or somebody who's more of a normal politician does anything that makes them annoyed, right? Anything that irritates sort of elite journalists. I'm worried that that tendency is always going to help the Trumps of the world and always going to hurt the Bidens. And that's not good for our democracy. Joy, you're exactly. No, it's not. And Dana, you're underselling yourself. No, thank you. Thank you for being someone who actually said this. And quite frankly, there's a racialized element to this as well, that I'm happy that you're the individual who said this, because this is something that black journalists have been screaming about since Donald Trump got into office. When the man ran basically saying, I'm going to clear out this country of anybody who's not white and straight. It took three years for large numbers of media outlets. And I'll say the names, not everybody at these particular outlets, but the Hill did this and political did this and the New York Times did this. We've all talked about this for years. It took almost three years for most of the mainstream press to say, hey, this guy is an actual existential threat to democracy. And people who talked about it, especially journalists of color were called alarmist or told they were being extreme. And then it literally took a man trying to overthrow an election and then send terrorists to try to overthrow the results of the election in January for a lot of folks to realize it. It is a problem. It is a danger. Is it entirely the fault of the media? No, it's not. But it is in part the fault. We don't hold each other accountable. And when people want to get angry at the messenger, instead of taking responsibility for the messages that they've been spewing, this is arguably one of the most important articles of journalism I have seen in a very long time. I'm so happy that we're bringing this to the fore, because as we go into 2022 and a lot of the things that they've talked about in the Atlantic start to manifest themselves. When you see in Georgia and Oklahoma and different in Texas, where large swaths of votes are going to get thrown out the window. If we don't establish the language and dialogue necessary to point these dangers out, then we will have stolen elections and 2024 will already be done."
750,MSNBC_MAGA_Era_Reckoning_White_Nationalists_March_At_Lincoln_Memorial.mp4," People visiting the Lincoln Memorial over the weekend were greeted with quite a sight. Hundreds of white nationalists marching down the steps with masks to keep their own identities hidden wearing shields and other armor. Many chanting quote, reclaim America. You can see the upside down American flags among many as well. About 100 years ago, the KKK staged a march past many of these monuments in D.C. The chilling images are here. And it was in essence a very similar message, including the show of power perceived or otherwise to try to do it in Washington. American democracy continues what some call decay and others call an outright slow moving crisis in front of our faces. Take the new Atlantic magazine, which warns January 6th was practice. Meanwhile, across our educational institutions, there are efforts to change our understanding and the next generation's understanding of history itself or to use today's political clashes to avoid any reckoning of what's wrong in the past, be that slavery and racism and misogyny and try to remove those stories for a political agenda today. So what is patriotism across all of this? That's a big question that the nation continues to debate. President Obama, really seeing a lot of what we were headed up against, made his own argument about this in the context of renewed white nationalism and racism and a black president when marking the 50 year anniversary of Selma's Bloody Sunday. Their faith was questioned. Their lives were threatened. Their patriotism challenged. And yet what could be more American than what happened in this place? To debate about truths regarding the past, but also where we want to go together into the future. The documentary filmmaker Ken Burns, celebrated for the time and depth he spends on these issues is now calling for an honest appraisal of the past as critical to where we go. He writes in the Washington Post, being American means reckoning with our, quote, violent history. I'm joined now by Ken Burns, his many award winning films address everything across our history from the Civil War to Vietnam to Hemingway, Muhammad Ali, and some of our favorite American cultural shared institutions like jazz and baseball. He also has launched an educational project that uses those films to teach about history. Welcome to the beat, sir. Thank you, Ari. Good to be with you. Good to have you. Tell us about what you were advocating, knowing all the minefields here and also knowing that I presume you want to continue your reputation as a thoughtful, nonpartisan or serious filmmaker. But you're wading into this to urge what? Well, I think just openness. We've always been interested in the facts in our works. Everything is rooted in the facts and the story. And when you hear about attempts to sort of adjust our history to something more comfortable, you realize that people who don't want to discuss our past are actually afraid of it and wish to perpetuate a status quo. It's interesting that you brought up all of the subjects in the historical moments that you did. We've created a site called Unum out of E Pluribus Unum out of many, one. We're interested in the one and what it means to come together, that it's just in the US, us and there's no them. And the history of human beings, unfortunately, is creating a them when there's not. Part of this is coming to terms with a complicated past and not being so afraid of it. And it may be our treatment of indigenous peoples, as we documented most recently for the Washington Post thing with the brutal massacre at Sand Creek in Colorado and all of that. It may be coming to terms with the fact that white supremacy has been a huge part of who we've been since the very beginning. I've got three films that I've been working on just in the last few months. One is on Benjamin Franklin. It's coming out in April. In the mid 1700s, people are complaining about the Germans coming in there. What they want are the beautiful white and red, meaning the Native Americans. It's it's ghastly comment by Benjamin Franklin, a founding father. We just finished a film on Muhammad Ali that was out in which because he took a faith based decision not to fight in Vietnam, America couldn't see a black man making a faith based decision that we felt like he was giving the middle finger to the country. And so they treated it as a political one. And we know all the problems that we went into. And we're working now on a history of the U.S. and the Holocaust, what we knew and what we didn't know, what we did and what we didn't do, what we should have done and the ways in which, unfortunately, our own sordid past inspired aspects of the Holocaust, from copying our Jim Crow laws for exclusionary laws against Jews to anti-immigration nativist policies that helped a resurgent Ku Klux Klan. The footage that you shared from the United States Capitol, as ghastly as it is, I mean, this is this is nothing new in American history and come to terms with it is, as the President Obama said, the most American thing to do. I don't know why this is even an issue. I don't know why you have me on, because this is why we were built. We're also a sports culture. You know, we're always complaining about what we didn't do well in that game and how we have to do better here. And somehow people are willing in almost every aspect of life to be brutally honest about themselves and their friends and their team and their this. But we can't do that about our history. Our history has become a political football. And what we're trying to do is return it to a place in which we can create a space with UNUM that was funded by the philanthropist David Rubenstein and by the Better Angels Society, create a space where people can have a conversation between the past and events that seem to rhyme. Because we know history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. And I'm in the business of rhyming."

805,MVI_0056.MOV," Mark time, march. Forward, march. Column right, march. You've got to shorten steps on the right side. Column right, march. Right side chop your steps, left side pull it out."
806,MVI_0057.MOV," With someone other than you should be doing the chop step fulcrum, you know So mark time march Forward march Column left march"
807,MVI_0058.MOV," left, you'll chop stuff off me. Alright, so line up like this. Alright, so what I'm gonna do is, when I call column left, I'm gonna basically, like I'm marching, I'm marching, I'm marching, I'm gonna stop and pick up my legs and just do this kind of thing. Alright, like I'm just turning the column on me. And when you're doing the chop step, you can lift your knees higher. A mark time looks like this. This is what a real mark time looks like, but we're not doing that because why? Alright, ready? Mark time, march. Forward, march. Watch out, yo. Column left, march. Nice. Forward, march. Column left, march. Forward, march. Mark time, march. Slow it down, slow it down. Column, halt."
808,MVI_0059.MOV, March by March and then you would go straight into forward march.
809,MVI_0060.MOV," on the left foot? It should be, it should just be a smooth transition, but for right now, like y'all see me mark time, and I think when y'all catch up to me, y'all want to mark time, so we're just gonna do that for now. But when we start doing like a real calm left, I'm the only one that's marked time, right? And then when y'all catch up to me, then it should just be like a smooth transition back to mark time. But just in general with mark time march, even without the turning. So wouldn't it be like, you know, mark time march, we're like this, and they say forward march, shouldn't we, we should always start on the left. Yeah, it's left leg, it's always left leg. So even, so if you were like, you say mark time, like forward march, and you're on the right, you should like take another step and then go. Right, so if the guy calling the command hooks it up, wait for the next left foot to step off that. All right, maybe I didn't illustrate that at the first time, that's my mistake, but if you, if I'm calling a column left, or if I'm calling mark time, right, we're mark timing, and I go forward march, I called it on my right foot, that's fucked up. I should be calling it on my left foot, so then what you'll do, column, or forward march, you'll be like, oh, boom. Right? Yeah, yeah."
810,MVI_0061.MOV," But the streets here, like all my guys are gonna stop here and now we're fucked up. But if I'm mark timing, mark timing, mark timing, and then I line myself up with where I want them to be, once they get on line I go, whoop. Go ahead. So if you're the guy behind the first pivot guy, you kind of rotate with him? Yeah, yeah. So if I'm in front of, Will's in front of me and he's mark timing, turn. Okay, so you just grab him. Right. Alright. Uh, what do we decide? Is it column or what are we doing? Uh, for what? It's a column. What do you want it to be? Like company? Uh, for just going forward? Yeah. Forward, uh, usually I just do forward. Alright. Alright. Yeah, that's what I say. Separate. Well, you can separate it out into two syllables, two like long ones. Yeah, well I like to draw my shot. Anyway, we're gonna go, we're gonna start with mark time, then we're gonna start marching from there, and then we're just gonna piece it up. Alright. Mark time, march. In step, in step. Forward, march. Don't anticipate. Good luck. Column right, march. There we go. That's good. Excellent. Step it up. Column right, march. Good. Good, 90 degree turn. Column left, march. Just go around the dog. Alright, so check it out. We fucked up. Keep going, keep going. We fucked up there, and it's a pivot point. Don't be fast. Slow it down."
811,MVI_0061.MP4," Sweet, let's load these up."
812,MVI_0062.MOV," There you go, better, much better. Going. Column left, march. What I mean, when I'm talking about the pivot points, I mean stay in your spot, don't move. We're making a full 90 degree turn, stay in your spot, march time in place, and pivot."
813,MVI_0062.MP4," I'm going to make a good rectangle. Oh, rectangle? Yeah, for good space. I'm going to put a rectangle in there and be a walk, okay?

815,MVI_0063.MP4," Yeah, just hold it. There you go. Fuck yeah, that looks great. Alright, here we go."

822,MVI_0092.MOV," Your arm's gonna stay in this moment. So when I'm doing a left hook here, I'm gonna rotate to my left first. So you're loading up, it's like you're loading up your shot, and then my arm's gonna stay in this 90 degree angle, and I'm just gonna twist around. It's just simple."
823,MVI_0093.MOV, The amount of like the ways you can get through it here you have a lot more coverage you can cover a lot more Another thing is that when you're in your guard Don't hold your hands out like this Because if my hands are held out like this like here stick your hands out like in front of you Someone hits them. They can you're just basically hitting yourself

831,MVI_0126.MOV," Keep your hands staying close, okay?"
832,MVI_0127.MOV," I mean James has got the aggression, he's reached far before. He's maybe overextending a little bit, but that's kind of normal for especially taller guys who are trying to use their length. He needs to bring his hands back to his face when he throws a punch and not look at me when I'm talking. So when he's punching he's not retracting his hands all the way back to his face. Strike, hand back, strike, hand back, strike, hand back, strike, hand back. Ten seconds. See how when James put it low like that Earl's got ahead to do is just give him a nice little tap with his cross."

849,MVI_0205.MP4," The advantage of when it's really thin is even if it's wet, it dries out real fast. Right. So we usually toss the candle in with the fire? Yeah. You know, just like start a bigger fire with it, take it out, and then kind of reuse it I guess? Yeah, you can reuse the candle if you get it going fast enough. Next time can you bring scented ones that are nicer? Those probably cost more, and I don't know, I think those might have some estrogenic properties too. I've heard that synthetic scents are bad. I don't know. I think it's not really well established either way. It's probably not that big of a deal, honestly. Like there's probably some scents that may very well be bad and some that maybe are harmless. Yeah. Would it surprise you if the 50% is lower? I think I just killed it. I don't know. Oh, you didn't kill it. That's a very high, that's an enormous reduction. But my point is, is the world not so evil? 50%. I feel like people with scented candles, their test levels are already lower by 50%. Yeah, that's the fucking matzo ball candle. Maybe one caused the other. Here we go. This is getting out of the atomic forest. Light it like that and stack them up? I can probably stab them into here. Depending on what they did, our parents, grandparents, great grandparents, working on it, in some cases, enormously, estrogenic stuff and not having their levels drop. That's semi-illness. It's kind of just we're just fucking around with it. It's terrible for you stuff in some cases. Take the thin stuff and you stack it. Like that. That's actually going to do pretty good, I think. There you go. Hopefully you can keep this upright. The candle thing. Yeah, it is a good idea. The candle's going. It's so small. Trying to figure out how to get these to stay upright, though. Lean them against the log. Lean them against the log, they'll burn upward, and then you can just start setting wood on top of it. Yeah, let's do it like this. Eee! I don't know how well that's going to work. You've been usurped. Did anyone actually bring tender? Or actually, whatever that is, the flint? That'll flint steel? I got firewood in this truck. Yeah, I didn't bring that. I brought a whole bag of dry land. Just the thin one? Yeah. Like the bottom of it? Now we've got something kind of going here. It's like trash can space in your house, and you're just dumping it along as you're walking along. If I collect all that fucking dust. Once you get it going, you've got to be cool. Start tossing it on polythene stuff. That's golden. That is golden. I think it's going to go. Hell yeah, dude. See, we mostly used up that candle, but that's all of ten cents. If that. Get a little bit of wax. It's a really, really cheap way to do this. You can actually also make your own homemade fire starters if you melt those candles and you kind of mix it in with the dryer lid. In an egg carton. Yeah, in an egg carton. It's like a scout trick. They got it, man. So, now, you want to kind of handle this from here? I will kind of start. We'll do a little demo over here. Anybody want to try doing this? Demonstration? Yeah, light the fire. It's a bake sale. Anybody like to try the dryer lid with the magnesium? Anybody want to try the lighter? Oh, do you have some, too? Yeah, I got one. No kidding. We'll probably take extra if everyone wants to try it out. Where do you get that from, Amazon? Yeah, it's like ten bucks. Alright. Ten bucks, and I've used it a few, like a lot of times, and it barely wears. It barely works? It barely wears out. Oh, right. So, you just go like this? Flip it over. Flip it over. The side I've already used is easier to use. Oh, so you want to, it's actually getting used, makes it easier. I think it does. I don't know. But, yeah, push in a little bit more, and you want it closer to that, so you want to get the spark onto it. Kind of got to aim, push in a little more, kind of drag it a little slower, and push in a little more. Scrape, like, hard scrape. You get like a nice big hole if you land it in the right spot in the light. Oh, that was almost it. That was close. I don't know, man. It's a lot of spark. It's surprising how much spark it sparks, but it doesn't... You're very close. You're like flame throwing that bitch. That's what I'm saying, like, I feel like, yeah, it's a lot of heat, but it's not taking off. Cut it into smaller strips. It'll light easier. All right. One other way. Oh, that's a good idea. Oh, there we go. Right into it. Right into it. Try it that way. Try it right into the base. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, now you're good. It's almost gone. Slower and bigger and push harder. There you go. That's it. You had it lit. I'll give you a better piece. No, no, no, it took off. I get it. It just takes a minute. Yeah, it just takes a little practice. That's why once you guys catch it, I'll try it. Yeah, let me try it. Yeah. Here you go. You should hold that one with my right hand. Flip it over. Flip this one that way. For whatever reason, it makes a difference. Yeah, you're almost getting it. There you go. Yep, yep. All right, who else wants to try? Got some more lint. If I had lived during the time when they didn't know what fire was, I would have been like, huh, this is interesting. I don't know what it does. Here, kid, you take this. I want to know how they did the stick. Hopefully he would have figured it out. Who else wants to try this? Do we have anybody else? Yeah, I'll give it a go. All right. We need a little more lint here. A little fresh lint. Oh, fuck. Yep, you're really close. There you go. Yep. Nice. Yep. Lint is really easy.

851,MVI_0216.MP4," Okay, you ready? Yep. Alright, here we go. To those who destroy our nation, we will destroy your symbols and all that you worship. To think we will lay down and perish, you are gravely mistaken. Burn them. Fire crackling. Here we go."

857,MVI_0340.mp4," The speech is Victory in our Shared Strength. First of all, I'd like to thank Alan and all those from Michigan for hosting this event. They gave up their time to share this experience. It was very humbling. Again, we appreciate it greatly for the invite. So why did our network involve ourselves so much in this hike? Well, there are many reasons for this. Number one, to make associates into brothers. Number two, to see the beauty of Michigan, right? And three, to escape the dread of our modern existence. But the main motivating factor is different. We at Network 12 have a vision. That's time has come. The idea started when I joined the organization. St. Louis is a place with heavy racial tension. Well, I found myself alone in the organization when I joined. It was a surprise at the time that there was no one else. A crossroads appeared before me. The left side of the road was named individualism. The right side of the road was collectivism. The left was selfishness. And the right was collectivism. The left was slavery. The right was freedom. The right side of the road was patriotism. The choice to me at this time was obvious. I joined for a reason. I understood the consequences ahead of me. For too long, I enjoyed the material of life while ignoring the spiritual. Over time, this kills your soul. The meting of the spirit is a long and hard task. To look within and criticize oneself is a hard pill to swallow. Escapism is this world's self-help. The vision became more clear thanks to two members. Kyle and Randy, stand up for me. Kyle Missouri joined a month after me, rejecting the notion that I'm alone in this city. This man and brother of mine has gone from stickering downtown to scaling up billboards and leading our stenciling team. He's very passionate about his beliefs. And it's something to be respected. The other man is Randolph, Illinois, someone I knew years before becoming associated in this community. When we first discussed our world views, I could tell he was a critical thinker. And we began to speak. The rest is history, and he stands here with me today. For all the criticism I give him, he is one of the most bravest men I've ever met. Through the passion and sweat of our labor, we created Network 12. Our first long-term goal was completed. The regional before the network spanned all the way from southern Illinois, all of Missouri, into eastern Kansas. They should be proud of this feat, just as I am. To take these accomplishments as my own is immoral. They are just as important. They're just as important as I am. So, thank you, brothers. You can sit down. Now the vision."

913,MVI_0815.MOV," So every command is on a four count. Okay? So it's always one, two, three, four, and then you start. You always start on the left foot. So you start off mark, time, free, march. And it's mark, time, mark, and... Forward, march, and... Mark, time, mark... Column, halt. And placing your left foot last as well. Yeah. Like we just did. Real quick, so who are you trying to keep in pace with, like, as your guide? The guy in front of you or the guy to the left? Both. You want to just start off simple marching, don't even bother with mark, time yet? I think it's best to always do mark, time, because otherwise we just start marching and we're going to start off all fucked up. So let's just do, again, it's going to be a four count. Four count. Mark, time, mark, and... And then left foot, one. All right? So let's try that real quick. Mark, time, mark... All right, hold on, stop. You guys jumped the gun on it a little bit. So just kind of keep in mind, I'll clap this time. A lot of times when you do it, you have a snare with you, so the next time I do it, it's going to be mark, time, mark, and... All right? So keep in your head that it's four, not three, all right? Mark, time, mark... Left, left, left, right, right, left, left, left, right, left, left, left, left... You're off, Adam. Left, left, left, left, left, left, left... Looking spiffy, Lewis. I want to practice just..."
914,MVI_0816.MOV," be starting in a stoppage. So, I'll give you a reminder again, so it starts off, uh, mark, time, mark, and then it's going to be a similar four counts up. Detail, hold. And you end this time with the left foot. Detail, hold. And boom. Like that, alright? So let's try both of those real quick. Mason, you might also want to touch on that, um, when you hear mark time, don't jump the gun and strike your left foot. You should be anticipating it. It's like, mark time, and then march is the executing word, you know? Yeah, so just always keep in mind that it's four count. So, I'll clap, and that way, we'll clap that way you guys can kind of play it in your head. So, just one more time before we start. Mark, time, march. And so what we usually do is I usually like end my end on the last count, which is silent. You do kind of like end, or Paul said like in his head he says step. So, like, mark, time, march, step. Alright, so let's try that. And just to be clear, a clap is your left foot striking. Yeah, exactly. So, with the clapping, Jesse was calling out to you, but for whatever reason, it's just clapping. There's no calling, it's just clapping. Alright, another quick thing, everyone is bound to get a, like, off sync of clapping."
915,MVI_0817.MOV," Like that. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Whatever it takes to get on the right foot. So we're going to try one more time. I'll show you one more time. This is what we're going to do. Mark, time, mark. Detail, halt. Okay. How did Bill stop on the left foot? Who stopped on the left foot? I stopped on the left foot. Alright. Let's try that one more time. Mark, time, mark. Detail, halt. Nice. That was much better."
916,MVI_0817.MP4," There you go. Go LETS GO, Eastern border! You all right? Goodbye! Thank you! See you all. Great kids! Why don't they go home? If you're a passenger why...Yeah why? Don't do shit.

Hey, if you wanna be on camera"
917,MVI_0818.MOV, safety again so this is what it's gonna look like mark time mark and then the command forward march again it's a four count and then you start off on the left foot so forward march and all right so let's try that there's actually a 100% correlation so far well well actually I don't know did you start on time did Pat start on time to Pat miss a beat sorry I forgot that

919,MVI_0819.MOV," We're actually moving as a formation. Obviously, we want to try and maintain the form of our group as much as we can. So when we are actually moving, everyone is going to look out of their peripheral vision to their right. Everyone here on the right side of the formation are the people keeping the real spacing in between them and the column in front of them. So how do we maintain that, right? All right, everybody on this side, except for you, John. These are in front. All right, put your right arm out like this. That is how far you should be from the column in front of you. With your fist closed, just for good measure. Jesse, just to clarify something, man, you say the column in front of you. Wouldn't that be a misnomer? Isn't this a column and this a row? Yeah, it's a row. It's a row. You got me. All right, so everybody, put your fist out. Fist out a little bit closer. Right to the back of their head. There you go. I don't actually know what it's required, but what is it when you're doing it? Fingers out, you know, allows more spacing. Now, everybody on your right arm, put out your elbow. Put out your elbow. Yeah, now bring it in to where the person is actually touching that elbow. Bring it close in. Elbows out, elbows out. There you go. Looks good. Third row. Clark's just doing a pose over there by himself. So basically, what we're trying to maintain is you're right behind the person in front of you."
920,MVI_0820.MOV," We are going to mark time and then forward march and then always start on your left foot. So let's try that. Mark time mark. Left, left, left, right, your left, your left, your left, right. Forward march. Left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, right, left, left, left, left. Look in front of you and look to the side of you. Straighten it out. Straighten out your rows. Left, left, left, back row, your way, way."
921,MVI_0821.MOV," So it's all about just keeping time and starting and stopping. Probably like, because if we just, there's a much more chance if you just, if everybody just says forward march, if you were going to start all different, all different tempos, the whole point of mark time is to get everybody like that. You might say it's like, it's like warming up your car before you. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like that. And it looks fucking cool. So let's uh, let's flip around."
922,MVI_0822.MOV, I think we should do a detail instead of column.
923,MVI_0823.MOV," Adam, what are you struggling with, man? I just suck at synchronization. Anyways, alright. Mark, eye, mark. Forward, march. Don't get too separated. Right, left, yo left, yo left, yo left, right. Yo left, yo left, yo left, right. Left, left, left."
924,MVI_0824.MOV," We don't speed up on the upside so we just take bigger steps. Yeah, yeah. Your stepping is always at the same cadence. It's only the distance. Everybody take 10 spaces back just to give more space. All right. So we're going to mark time. We're going to march. And I'm going to say right face. Yeah, that's good. And we'll demonstrate that for all these guys, all right? Right first. Huh? Wait, what are you? OK, now wait. We'll do right first. What's up? Is this a right turn or a right face? Oh, a right turn. Sorry. Not a right face. A right turn. We're not doing faces just yet. OK. Mark time, mark. Left, left. Left, left. Did I start wrong? I hear some shit. I like it. Here it goes. Don't worry about it. Just get in place before we start. All right. Left, left. You're all done. Daniel, stomp a little bit more. Left, left. Right, right, left. Left. Your left. Your other left. Your left. All right, guys. Stop, stop, stop."
925,MVI_0825.MOV," Mark time mark March Very nice That's how the turns go and they got here, right Mark time mark Detail So I noticed there when they turned they kind of stopped a little bit and reformed just for a second and then continued moving forward Is that normal or?"
926,MVI_0826.MOV," with the feet, right? Whereas, John will speed up a little bit, a little faster than Daniel, and Paul on the end is gonna, yeah, increases strides so we have that nice, those nice turns like that. So that's what we're trying to demonstrate. So why don't we try it? Step back a little bit to give us more space. Watch out one more time. Basically what we're trying to maintain through this is, that's the swivel. Yeah, bring it in boys. One running up, one running in front of us and behind us. We're also trying to keep the line looking nice while we execute the turn. Let's demonstrate a right turn so we can show them, you know, that all kind of be stationary. March, John, march. March, John, march. March, John, march. Forward, march. Forward, march. Right turn. Right turn. Right turn. Right turn. Right turn. Right turn. Forward, march. Forward, John."
927,MVI_0827.MOV," Just the first row. Everyone look at Paul on the left there. Make sure you get that one extra beat out of it. Mark time, mark game. Whereas Robert, you're going to be picking it up a little bit because you're on the end. Mark time, march. And left, left, yo left, right left. There we go. Forward march. Left, left, left. And turn. Left turn, left turn, there we go. Very nice. Good job boys. There you go."
928,MVI_0828.MOV, We're not going to be going around like a straight left turn on streets like that. So it would kind of be just slow down. But we'll get the hang of that. And you've just got to judge based on the turn you're going to make. So next row. Mark time march. Forward march. Left face. Left face. Mark time march.
929,MVI_0828.MP4," I'm going to shoot you in the head. I'm an expert. I'm starting with you. I need a second. Everybody pay attention, please. We're going to wait for everybody else to get on and then we are going to get on. I'm going to shoot you in the head."
930,MVI_0829.MOV," Left, left, left, left, turn. There we go. Left, right, left, right, left, group, halt, halt."
931,MVI_0829.MP4, First team gets turning Second team is leaving collaborative fire Comet goes off Second teammate grabs a shack Last team is tossing
932,MVI_0830.MOV," up the rows behind us, straight into us. It's going to be small steps, you know, very small steps. That also prevents, you know, I saw for a couple of the rows, when the turn was being done, the person on the inside stopped completely and then they started completely when everybody was in line. We want to prevent that. That's going to make our spacing really weird."
933,MVI_0831.MOV, Go left. Left. Left. Left. Forward march. Left. Right. Turn. Left. Left. Right. Left. Fix it. Left. Left. Good. Left. Right. Left. Go left. Go left. Go left. Right. Go left. Go left. Go left. Right. Left. Left. Turn. There we go. Good stuff. Right. Left.
934,MVI_0832.MOV," Probably not a huge deal. We'll get there eventually though. So when it comes to doing a facing movement, these are turns executed while standing still. Make sense? In other words, it looks like this. For a left face, it's gonna be here, here, right? You pivot on your left toe and on your right, wait, no. Your left heel and your right toe, yep. So just like that. If anyone knows boxing, just watch the video. Give me one more demonstration, please. So for a left face, it's gonna look like this. It's a two count movement here, here, right? For the right face, exact same thing, except opposite. If you can't see me, go ahead and make some room or move up just to get a nice look at it. For a right face, it's gonna be right face, one, two, right? For left face, left face, one, two, right? Face."
935,MVI_0833.MOV," Left, and then you start with your first foot movement, and then as soon as you say face... We want to say the whole command before it's executed so we know exactly what we're doing. We had previously done it a different way, but we're implementing a new memo. It's a reform, you know. Sure, reforms. Yeah, yeah. Left, face! Get in there, get in there, we'll keep working on it."
936,MVI_0833.mp4," I'm going to be on this side. First. Yes. Watch the ground. Hang on! Hang on! Get off the street! Get in the car! Get in the car! Get in the car! Get in the car! Traffic jam. Watch me. Oh, now they're moving. 14-13. Keep going. All the way. Keep going. Vehicle exchange got a crash. Two of the box trucks have slashed tires, broken windows, etc. And we need to survey damage at the vehicle exchange to vehicles, anything, and depending. And there was an infiltrator. The tech guys are finding out who it is. I'm going to delete him as soon as I get the name. Well, there he is."
937,MVI_0834.MOV," of a square again? Alright. Alright. Face! Adam. Oh man. It's not just a turn, buddy."
938,MVI_0834.MP4," Use the eye holes. You're right to the right of your rook. Let's show it off. Small shields up. Cover your feet. Look good, gentlemen. All shields keep your eyes open. Good. With all these bad kids, you just pop out of each other's... You're all fucked up with kill me, huh? Time to go to kill me. I'm all fucked up. You're okay."
939,MVI_0835.MOV," Right face. Perfect, perfect, good. Getting there. Right face. A little more dramatic. Watch this guy. Two count action. Left face. Left face. The aesthetic that is."
940,MVI_0836.MOV," It's basically just mix it all together. We're going to try marching with various commands and see how long we can go without them. And then, you know, mess it up. Let me ask you. Yeah. Does his mayor or does Jesse's 4B seem a lot faster than you and Alexander's? For which command are you talking about? Just the marching type of. Is it faster? I'm not sure if it works. This thing's so cool. It sounds good. Look at that. You look like you're wielding a lightsaber. I feel like I am."
941,MVI_0837.MOV,
942,MVI_0838.MOV, Good. Set go. Jump jump jump. Oh boy. Okay one more. Alright let's try it one more time. Okay one more time. Okay let's try it one more time. Okay let's try it one more time. Okay let's try it one more time.

944,MVI_0839.MP4," Yeah, you guys don't need to be doubled up. Come over here."
945,MVI_0840.MOV," Put them in that bin out there. On the left. No, no, no. Out there. Oh, okay. Ignore me. I don't want to get caught. Yeah. Everybody! I'm going to get lost in there. Okay. Uh, when you get out of this place, take all the stuff in that big gray trash can and put the remaining stuff in this... Thomas is going to wash all of it."
946,MVI_0840.MP4," I know, but we have to be able to work our culture. So, that's what, you know, can you give us a hint of where it might be coming from? Um, we have a few minutes of time. I'll talk to you after. Yeah. I appreciate the information. Thank you, sir. I'm going to attend to you guys. All right, good. Thank you."
947,MVI_0841.MOV, What are you doing? What are you doing? Everybody get out of the way. What are you doing? Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
948,MVI_0842.MOV, Oh Shit oh sorry I spilled a little coffee. Oh man I
949,MVI_0856.MOV," Well, say step to advance. So your left shoulder should be pinned on the shield right here. See right here?"
950,MVI_0859.MOV," Step, recover. Step with the left, recover with the right. Step with the left. I still think they should give a little grunt when they do it, but Tom doesn't like it. That'll come organically. We'll just have people do it anyway. So we'll just demonstrate with that, and then we'll switch off with another floor. Okay, so lock, step, lock, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step. Yeah."
951,MVI_0860.MOV," In fact, let's start off with a march. So, march time, march! Forward, march! Okay, now you have some, some, hey, take the mask off, fascist! Lock, stab, lock! And then, then you stop, because we're not going to be proceeding, don't agitate them for now. You're not, you're not going to be proceeding, you know, to the beat of a march. You need..."
952,MVI_0861.MOV, and we're gonna begin marching and then some issues issues go back go back go back and we're gonna see some issues and then you'll hear lock step lock at which point you can stop you know until you're told to step you don't have to keep marching yeah so March time March left left left
953,MVI_0864.MOV, bit of chaos or a fray right? There's just like a screaming libtard or something and we you know we might want to or like an antifa sitting let's say there's one antifa like Adam said just sitting down right here you know it's not going to be a brawl so you know the front row will present their shields and be intimidating and all that but do you need to be like really bracing the guy in front of you hard? No because you know but if there's like a crowd gathering when they're spaced like a bow and arrow Jesse is going to be section lead here so opposition

1062,Neo_Nazi_Group_Patriot_Front_Does_Reclaim_America_March_At_US_Capitol.mp4," So what happened on January 6th? Does anyone remember? That day? January 6th is an irrelevant date. It's just another link in the chain link or whatever. You know, in the chain, whatever. My analogies. Really, what the problem in this country is, is white supremacy. The problem in this country is fascism. I want to ask you, how do you feel about Adolf Hitler? How do you feel about Nazi Germany? If your answer is, not too good, then I have a follow-up question. Do you know where Adolf Hitler got his ideas from? You know where he came up with the laws that he instituted in Germany in the 1930s? You know where he came up with that stuff, right? That's right, the United Motherfucking States of America. The Jim Crow South. In fact, in fact, Adolf Hitler thought that the Jim Crow South system of governance in the United States was so extreme and so racist and such an apartheid system, he thought it would not even be possible to institute in Germany. He thought that the Jim Crow South was so bad that there was no way he could go that far. So, that leads us to going back to the United States. This country is fucked up. This country had a civil war over the idea that black people were property. The fuck? And then, right, the civil war ended and everyone was like, I'm gonna turn the page. I'm gonna turn the page. Right? So in the 1920s, especially, there was a group called the Daughters of the Confederacy. A group of women whose parents and grandparents fought in the civil war and they wanted to whitewash the history of the civil war. They wanted to make it seem like it was heritage, not hate. And they erected all these statues of Confederate generals all across the country. Right? That's what they did. Look at the amount of monuments to the Confederacy that were put up. Most of them were in the 1910s and 20s, okay? And then, so, now think about this. So, now we're the Daughters of the Confederacy. These people weren't around in the civil war. Some of them maybe were, but not many. And then they have kids. Now we're in the 1950s and 60s, alright? So now they have kids. And those kids' parents were the Daughters of the Confederacy. So again, they fight a war over the right to own black people. Wow. That's fucking, that's fucked up. Then, they lose, but there's no punishment. There's no accountability. Right? Then, they're like, oh fuck. Well, you don't want to be in a situation where you hate your parents, right? So you're thinking, well my, you know, they were just doing the best that they could. You know, they were doing this over other reasons. They didn't really want to own black people, right? And then, they have kids. Right? Now we're in like, you know, 1990s. Right? Racism's over. There's black people on TV. The Civil Rights Movement. Look, black people get to vote now. Isn't that great? Isn't that cute? The blacks get to vote. What a good country we are. We are so good to those people. Aren't we amazing? Right? Wow. There's no reparations. Redlining is still a problem. Look at police brutality. But this country solved racism. And then, there's a black president. Racism's over. It's done. No one cares anymore. It's in the past. We've turned the page, right? Wrong, motherfucker. Wrong. Look at this shit. Okay, I need you to watch what's going on in this country. Right? January 6th. Is it a problem? Yeah, they tried to fucking literally destroy the US government. Again! Again! Again! This happened in the 1800s, right? The 1840s, 50s, 60s, and 70s. They tried to destroy the government and they failed. And then, so ever since then, they've been working around behind the scenes. They've been, you know, whitewashing the things. They've been trying to control education. They've been doing all this and that and this and that. And now, here we are. They tried to overthrow democracy. Quote, unquote, we don't live in a democracy. We live in a fucking fascist republic. I personally think so. That's what we live in now. Right? It's just not openly fascist yet. But anyway, that's a whole other topic. Right? They tried to literally destroy the government. Nothing happened. Donald Trump's still going out there saying, oh, they stole the election. Now look at what we got. We got literal neo-Nazis. Remember what happened in Charlottesville? You remember that? No accountability. No lessons learned in this country. Life, liberty, victory! Life, liberty, victory! Life, liberty, victory! Life, liberty, victory! Life, liberty, victory! Life, liberty, victory! Folks, like, I mean, like, we got a whole thread here that's just like, it's incredible. Like, you see this. There's a lot of these motherfuckers. People think, oh, January 6th. There's only a couple hundred doofuses in January 6th. Right? There's only a couple hundred doofuses. Look, it was the QAnon shaman. It was my grandma. They were wandering, and they didn't know what was going on. Just a bunch of doofuses. Now, a year later, almost, 11 months later, this is a literal neo-Nazi march. Do you want to know what Patriot Front is? You might not have heard about them. Patriot Front is the spin-off group of Patriot Prayer. Now, why did they spin off? You might be wondering. Well, there were a lot of mass shootings, terror attacks from the right, like the El Paso shooter, that kind of stuff. And there was a big divide in right-wing paramilitary militias. Do we endorse these mass shooters? Do we endorse these right-wing terrorists? Do we endorse the destruction of synagogues across this country? Do we endorse the murders of black churches? Do we endorse police killings of black people? Patriot Front is the group of people that were like, yeah, we do endorse those things. The other people were like, no, we should stay. We should wear the suits and the ties and then, you know, do a little bit more before we openly embrace violence. Patriot Front, they said, no, fuck that. It's time to embrace violence. These are the fucking groups of spin-offs, right, of the other groups. These are the motherfuckers that decided, yes, violence is good. Fascism is good. Kill the black people once and for all. And again, I need you to understand that this isn't going anywhere. Oh, Biden won. Biden won the election. The problem solved. Racism is solved once again. Are you joking? Is this a funny joke that you're playing? Is this like a routine? Are you doing like a stand-up bit? Racism's over. Again, folks, I mean, this shit's fucked up. Like, again, like, they're literally at the Capitol wanting and demanding to reclaim America....and use for idiots. Look at this cowboy hat bullshit. Again, they're just literally wandering around. And you can look at this whole thread yourself. It got a little bit hectic as well. They got lost, apparently, which I found very entertaining. But again, these groups have been terrorizing America for years. They tried to overthrow the Capitol. They failed. Or did they? They're just gonna try again. Right? They've been doing this all across the country. Forever. Ever since the Civil War ended. And no one gives a fuck. The only people that give a fuck is Antifa! And look at how the mainstream media treats Antifa! Right? The only time that there's any consequences for any of these motherfuckers is when anti-fascists show up and run them off. But you know what happens? When that happens, the cops abuse anti-fascists and protect the fascists. Right? We've seen this happen over and over and over. I mean, again, look at Charlottesville, right? Anti-fascists show up and say, We don't like this. Things get spicy. Right? And then the police show up and allow all the murders to happen. And are right-wingers ever murdered? No. No. No. Whenever cops are involved, they're protecting the right-wingers. Right? Because no one gives a fuck. No one gives a fuck. And every time that they lose, quote-unquote, every time that they get ran out of a city, which happens all the time, you see countless videos posted of, oh, look, we made fun of the fascists in X city, Philadelphia, Denver, Portland, etc. Then they just come back! With more cops, more guns, more people. And eventually, they're gonna come back. And then again, look what happened in Florida. There was this case of an anti-fascist. After January 6th, they posted on Facebook that we need to prepare to defend ourselves. They got five years in jail for a Facebook post. So the only people in this country that are willing to do anything at all about the incoming fascist threat are being thrown in jail for Facebook posts. I need you to understand, right? When everyone who runs these people out of cities, like Philadelphia, Denver, Portland, etc. When they are all in jail, then what? Then they're just gonna go around, wreak havoc, and then maybe January 6th, 2025, will be the time that they overtake the government? Folks, I need, I don't know, I've been going off on this one, but like, if you're one of those dumb motherfuckers who's like, Antifa's just as bad as the neo-Nazis. Were you saying that same thing in 1944? You know, Hitler's really bad. But the idea is that but the idea, you know, remember that Candace Owens quote where it was like, you know, Hitler building concentration camps and committing a genocide of Jewish people, that's fine as long as he stayed inside the borders. When he went into Poland and France, that was really when Hitler got out of control. He should have just kept the concentration camps in Germany. That's what Candace Owens said, remember that? Like the idea that combating racism is as bad as racism itself, I'm sorry, it's dumb as hell. I mean, it's dumb as hell. And you see these people, they're not that bright. I mean, in order to be a fascist, you can't be that bright. Their organizing isn't that good. But it's a hell of a lot better than the left. There is no organizing on the left because whenever there is organizing on the left, people get shot and killed, people get assassinated, people get thrown in jail. And whenever there's any threat against the fascists, whenever there's any hint of consequence, the cops come in and beat the shit out of everyone else. 80% of cops voted for Trump, the guy who tried to overthrow the country, the guy who tried to destroy the United States. 80% of cops voted for that guy. So if you think anti-fascists and fascists are having a street fight, if you think that the cops are going to be an equal arbiter there, I'm sorry, you're delusional. They got this same treatment yesterday in DC that they did on January 6th. The cops kept all the critics away, all the anti-fascists away, and they let the fascists do whatever they wanted. So I don't know, man. This country's fucked up. This country is fucked up."
1063,oct_ar_draft1.mp4," Adam Harris, Chelsea Williams, we're with the FBI. Ask me a couple questions because you posted some stuff about Patriot Club. The FBI has placed ads at gas stations, on billboards, and on the radio. These yellow letters spell out Black Lives Matter.

1068,P1000321.MP4," Alright, ready to go. This is Luke Accordiot, reporting for Media to Rise. We are currently out here at Montgomery State Park, out in Tennessee. This weekend, the American Renaissance is putting on a conference, and they've allowed us access to come and document the events here this weekend. It's currently Friday. Everyone is kind of getting set up. People are starting to show up today. We're already seeing a large police presence going on. There's a lot of different checkpoints being set up. Due to the fact that protesters and certain individuals have been here before, protesting the conference, the American Renaissance usually is in this venue or other conferences every year. I don't like where this is going, so I'm signing off on media."
1069,P1000322.MP4," Yep, you're ready to go. We need his eyes to be documented. Matters of wisdom. Okay."
1070,P1000323.MP4," We're at the Renaissance, it's their annual conference, the first year's conference in quite a little bit of a decisive decade. There's going to be quite a few speakers this weekend, a couple vendor booths inside and a couple additional things going on. They've allowed us access to come and document what goes on during the event. It's going to be a three day event, tonight the event will stop. Should I keep going? No, because I'm..."
1071,P1000324.MP4," 3, 2, 1, go! We are on the way to the American Renaissance, it's their annual conference this weekend. They've given media to rise access to the document that goes on inside the venue. The event this weekend is titled the Decisive Decade. There's going to be quite a few speakers, quite a few vendor booths inside. So we're going to check it out, see the atmosphere here. Already we're seeing a large law enforcement presence inside of the......club! Inside of the club."
1072,P1000325.MP4, We are currently out here in Tennessee. This weekend American Renaissance is holding their annual conference. They've given us access to the document that goes on inside the venue. So we've just arrived here. It's Friday evening. The event doesn't kick off until later tonight. There's going to be some opening remarks. For now we're going to kind of stroll around the event venue here and set the stage for what's going to take place tomorrow.
1073,P1000327.MP4," There was some stuff over here. No, it was usable. Except maybe... Like the way you ended it, I think maybe you have a better ending. We can splice in there. You don't need to redo the entire thing. So it ended with... We're going to go around and check out some of the spots. Didn't we say that in the last one though? Yeah, we used the strolling around to set the stage. Yeah. So we want to... So we're going... We're going to go investigate the area. Sneaky sneaky. I think each of these, because that was the intro, these are each encapsulated pieces of information. So this piece of information is that the cops are here, crowd control, and this should be paving the way for the next one, which is what about protesters? So then we're going to go down to the protest area. I think we should go down to that bridge. So don't mention anything about the protesters. It should pose a question, but the next one is going to answer it. Which is, you know, so we see police here, they're doing crowd control, they're making sure people are here for the right reasons, and we're going to be looking into, or we're going to be investigating the situation. So we're going to be investigating, we're going to be investigating their plans for the counter protesters. And then we can go over and we can show them the gate, we can show them some of that stuff, maybe we can even show them that big checkpoint thing, we're going to mention the checkpoint, because each thing gives you a piece of information, poses a question, and then the next one is going to answer that. I like investigating the plan for the counter protesters. So maybe we can say, we're going to be investigating the police's plan for the counter protesters, and tomorrow we'll find out the counter protesters' plan for the police. I like it. Let's go. That's really good. Today we're going to find out what the police have planned for the counter protesters, and tomorrow we're going to find out what the counter protesters have planned for the police. Hell yeah. Audio, please take a break. One second."
1074,P1000328.MP4," All right, so we're already starting to see a large presence from law enforcement here at the venue. As you can see behind me, they're set up in front of the building to make sure that people getting in are here for the right reasons. We're also seeing a checkpoint outside of the area here. There's a lot of activity going on. There's a lot of activity going on in the area. All right, so we're already starting to see a large presence of law enforcement here. As you can see behind me, the police have set up a little checkpoint to make sure that people getting into the venue are here for the right reasons. They're getting ready for maybe a little bit of crowd control this weekend. There's also a checkpoint outside of the area here. They're definitely prepared. We've heard that they may be shuffling the protesters to a different side of the park where we're at. So we're going to go investigate what the police have planned for the protesters. And then tomorrow we're going to be investigating what the protesters have planned for the police. Too rough?"
1075,P1000329.MP4," Using Apple stuff? You don't even have a good excuse to be a spy. Well I am on my phone. Well yeah, well on your laptop you're not so no.

Alright, I'm gonna go get a bunch of books and stuff out of the car. You need any help with something? Ooooo. Nah, I'm good. Alright, well I'll see you later."
1076,P1000330.MP4," Alright, so we're in the conference here. They're getting set up for this weekend. We've got quite a few chairs. They're expected to have over 200 people and to quote them, they're going to push it to the fire code for attendance this year. So we're going to have tons of people in the crowd here. We've got the podium set up. Along the walls here there's going to be the vendor tables. And then this is where the speeches will happen tomorrow night. Here, get one."
1077,P1000331.MP4," We've got this set up along the wall here. The party's starting to get ready for the event. We've got plenty of chairs set up. We're expecting maybe 200, over 200 people to pull up the Amaranth staff. They're going to be pushing it to the fire department for attendance this year. We've got plenty of tables and chairs set up.

We've got all the tables and chairs set up for the audience. To quote the Amaranth staff, I think we're going to have well over 200 people in attendance. They're going to be pushing it to the fire code. Alright, and here we have the stage where all the speakers are going to do their speeches tomorrow night. This podium here is going to see a lot of speeches."

1081,P1000335.MP4," I like aligning a lot more. Can you get a little bit closer? Bam. That looks good. Audio. I'll give you one when I walk down. Okay. Maybe one... Are you doing videos? Yes. Maybe one behind him, like, showing... I'll get this. Got somebody coming in?"
1082,P1000336.MP4," Alright, recording? Mm-hmm. Good to go? And you're recording on audio. Alright, so we're right outside of the conference hall right here. And so outside, as you can see, there's a little hill with some parking. And at previous conferences that have been held here, the protesters have managed to kind of get up very close. I've also been told that they've actually gotten up all the way to the windows here, and they've been trying to get up to the windows. And I'm not sure if that's true, but I'm not sure. But I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. know if. Alright, good to go? Good to go? Alright."
1083,P1000337.MP4," You can see the point out here, outside. Outside, you can see the space. You can point down, this is the space. You can see the rise as you can see. You can see the light coming in. Right, all the poles are in this really cool light. So if you walk past this one, you'll get illuminated all through. Do you want me to walk towards you or away? Let me be this way so you can see."
1084,P1000338.MP4," Buckle up, because it's just g AVM. My 90 days off."
1085,P1000339.MP4, We've got the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. As you can see we've got the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation man here. They're very well-trained. They're going to be investigating this case.
1086,P1000340.MP4," Alright, so as you can see we've got the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation van, little command center setup. Alright, so as you can see we've got the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation van setup here. It's kind of their command center. You might just see the top of the iceberg. Jesus!"
1087,P1000341.MP4," Check, check, go. Alright, so as you can see we've got the... That thing looks too good to not see. There you go. Alright, so as you can see we've got the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation band set up here. It's maybe their command center for this weekend. It's a sign of things to come. They're definitely very well prepared."
1088,P1000342.MP4, What if Tom just took over my job? I don't have enough things to do.
1089,P1000343.MP4," Alright. Thank you, Luca. Subtitles. Most courage I would need to run through, you'd be reading all the signs. Can you guys get some tight shots of above the car, that little hill? I got you."
1090,P1000344.MP4," And I think their response was to just flood those positions with people who were willing to take it up and like actually never... So it was like an enticement thing? Like we want to make sure we get all these guys to live in yippy positions? Um, which... do you recall which way to go? I feel like we're going the wrong way, right? We should head to the right. We'll go this way. Um, I think it was like, uh... I don't want to think about it, like these guys didn't do anything to earn the titles. Like, like John, for instance, never went to any events except for... Which one's John? Redhair. Gotcha. Um, Beach Boy. Beach Boy. Beach Boy. Straha. Ginger. Um, and then, so yeah, they flooded all these positions with like people that no one knows. And, uh..."
1091,P1000345.MP4, We are lost. I think we're at the entrance now. I think we're at the entrance now.
1092,P1000346.MP4," So, I think that's a problem. You have people that are not actually expecting that action. Like, making decisions on actions that they have to make. That's like, in a government, you have people grabbing a gun, and now you're saying, what's the reason for saying that? They can't fight. But, if they're trying to revamp it, and they're coming back,"
1093,P1000347.MP4," You got all this Tom? Yeah. Okay. Howdy. Yeah, we're staying in the villa, but we're going to go down here and do some media stuff. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Camera in the face. There was two cameras and both of us were just like... Dude, I should have pulled up a camera. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
1094,P1000348.MP4, Mason did you get any footage of like the cones and everything that they had set up? I'm sorry what? This is Luka Kordia.
1095,P1000349.MP4," With this so no audio SD card access All right, you recording I am recording All right, so we are now across the river or a lake. I think it's a lake. So all right, so say body of water Maybe we should look this up. I don't know. It's not it's definitely not a river. It's like the lake So we're now across this vast ocean that separates the conference. Okay All right now so there's a body of water that separates the conference from the proposition area All right. So we're now across there's a small body of water that separates the conference venue from this little All right, so we're now across this small little body of water that separates the conference venue little staging area and we received We received word that the police are gonna kind of funnel the protesters over here and keep them away from the venue We're gonna go down here and check it out It's uh, it may be a little too wild tomorrow for us to come down here and document what's going on, but we're gonna try We're gonna see what these guys are up to I want to know what that guy's up to. Who's that guy? Not that guy this guy. This is luke accordion. We have thomas Stupid hat Stupid hat"
1096,P1000350.MP4," Yeah, whatever. I'll do that down here. Unless you want me to do it. No, no, no, whatever. I'll get some......roof shelter shots."
1097,P1000351.MP4," Actually, we're rolling this the whole time. Alright, here we go. Alright, so as you can see, this is where the bridge that separates the conference venue to this little staging area has been barricaded off. They're going to have officers here tomorrow. And up here is kind of the staging area where they're going to corral the protesters from the actual venue. We've got a little area here, and up here is a parking lot where they're going to be kind of funneling in. We're not sure what they're going to do, but we're anticipating an angry mob of people that want to show resistance to people gathering just to hear a speech."
1098,P1000352.MP4," Audio was not recording that entire time. That's sick. Make it clear like how small this parking lot is. Audio, audio, audio. Do you want to walk down there again? I like the fact, I like us getting a shot like at the barricade and stuff like that. Yeah. And make it clear how small this parking lot is. Like they're going to be corralled in this small parking lot. As in this? Yeah. Yeah. Given the circumstances, we don't think they're going to play along. Okay. Yeah. I mean, unless you don't want to say that. No, I like that. I'm just trying to. I just couldn't remember. Wow, terrible idea, Thomas. Jesus. I'm just trying to help, okay? I like the long shots that I got here. All right, so this here is, this is the only bridge that separates the conference venue to this little staging area here. As you can see, the police have it barricaded off. They're going to keep the protesters as far back as possible. Up here we have a small little staging area. We're not sure if they're going to play along. They might get a little upset that they're not allowed into the conference to hear the amazing speeches that are going to be going on. Up here we have a, up here there's a small parking lot where they're going to be corralling everyone together. And then we expect them to come down here and give their small little protest of anger. Good night. Good night. Hey, are there, Luca, are there any celebrities coming down here on this end of the pavilion? Or no wait, hold on. Whatever, we're not putting my audio in there anyways. Yeah, yeah. We're not putting my audio in there. So we're not sure, so we're not sure exactly who's going to show up. We do anticipate some key figures of the anti-free speech, anti-white movement that's going to be out here. We're hoping that they show up. We're going to hope to maybe get an interview with some of them and see why they're out here oppressing free speech and people organizing inside of a conference venue to hear speeches. That's him right there. This is the one. We have."
1099,P1000353.MP4," This would be a great road to get a leaf shot. I'm going to hop out and see if I can get that. I can get it low enough to all of the UCO tires. Just give me a second, I'll holler at you. Can I get out? How do I get out? Bam, gotcha. Just come back and get me, okay? Alright. Alright. I'm going to get out. Just give me a second, I'll holler at you. Can I get out? How do I get out? Bam, gotcha. Just come back and get me, okay? Alright. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam."
1100,P1000354.MP4," Shit, we forgot one of our camera guys. Hilarious! It's so funny. How'd I look?"
1101,P1000355.MP4," So, do we have to go that way now? No. Oh. Alright. I want to get some footage of the......cool backwater."
1102,P1000356.MP4," Oh, yeah You"
1103,P1000357.MP4," I got a good amount of takes for it. It's four o'clock now that guy was full of shit. He's probably two hours behind We don't need to let go check in or anything Yeah, oh they know"
1104,P1000358.MP4," Not so bad in late May, this time of year would be a bit of a cold bath, but he got a black eye, but he gave us a black eye. The state of Tennessee is trying very hard to paint us as dangerous extremists of whom they would be entirely justified in keeping us out of their pristine state park. We do not want to give them any kind of excuse for making a decision of that kind. So, please, please, have nothing to do with it. I tell you, you have a duty to retreat. This may not be in the nature of our people, but on this occasion you have a duty to all of us and to American Renaissance to retreat. Now I understand from the security people that unlike in previous years, they won't be on the other side of the parking lot. They will be across a small body of water. If you go to the lobby area and the dining room area, you go out on a balcony, and you can look across and you will see a little studio."

And if so, what sort of curious and colorful things is it likely to say? But, you must crush your inner Margaret Mead. Leave them strictly and absolutely alone. I mean, this is serious. This is absolutely serious. This is really the one thing that can go wrong. I mean, I could fall flat on my back, all the speakers could be drunk upstage, that'd be fine. But if we get into fisticuffs and antifa, that is very, very dangerous. We don't want that to happen. Now, I have some bad news about the lineup for medical reasons. The great Colin Flaherty has come to a very sensitive stage in his heroic battle with cancer. And he will not be with us, but there will be a musical tribute to him, which is from the heart, and one to which I'm looking forward very much. But it is a deep regret for me that Colin Flaherty, who's going to have his first AMRAN conference, will not be able to join us. He's really a great and wonderful fellow. Then, another medical mishap, David Cohn will not be with us. Yes, the signs that have risen up, that resonate perfectly with me, these are my favorite lines."
1106,P1000360.MP4, I think a president like us can be elected in future places in Europe.

And they know very well that without your express permission there not to make an image of your face or record your speech, your privacy is of paramount importance to us. We know just how evil the times are in the list that you run, merely being here. So also, I ask all of you, even Tyler, please refrain from taking photographs. If you do take photographs, make sure that the background is clear. I know that it is sometimes a tricky thing to ask, but please respect everyone's privacy. This is very important. Keep alcohol only in this room. It's not to go out in the hall or back out into the rooms. Smoking is possible in two places. One is when you go out to the dining area, there is a bridge off towards over the water, a really nice little view. You may smoke there. And also at the end here, there is a smoking area. So please restrict your smoking to those places. I think you've all discovered no firearms."
1108,P1000362.MP4," Oh, one thing is, there is a party Saturday night after the festivities are over, the real festivities begin, and there are not a few among you who think that's the absolute best part of America. That is not a scoundrel, and I don't necessarily blame you. Now, it's going to be quite cold, and most of you will be walking down the coast bridge, there will be a little map, maybe the map's already out there that will show you where to go to the villa where the party will be held. But because it will be cold, please take precautions, we don't want any Jack London stories coming out of this conference. So, what else? Oh yeah, we have with us an outfit called Media to Rise, and I would like the people who are with us to identify themselves. Raise your hand, raise your hand. Okay, you three. These fellows are very much on our side. They are making a documentary that I think will be honest and fair, and so you need not take precautions around them of the sort that you ordinarily would around the press. Others, if they show up to the press, they'll have a little red press badge, but these guys, they are neutral, honest, objective observers. The only ones in America. So, we will meet again tomorrow at 9am, and our habit is to really start on time. So when we say 9am, we mean 9am, because if things begin to slide, the speakers will end the program, get cheated their time, and really believe that white people can cooperate on their own time. And my final words to you, don't feed the animals, don't talk to the animals, and don't be a zoo animal. Thank you very much."
1109,P1000363.MP4," It has been my entire life's work and it is by far the project that is just... I mean, to say that I'm passionate about it is a lie. It's all he does. I wake up, I do it, I go to sleep, I wake up, I do it, I go to sleep. Everything that I eat, everything, everywhere that I go, everybody I talk to, I don't have any friends or assumptions or anything outside of the organization. I got my mother and my father, and believe me, if they could join me to try to get this done, so it's just... It's not like I've given up anything, because everything I have, I have for the benefit of the organization. Media to rise, press badge, the power of the press badge, powerful. I believe this has been a wonderful experience, and I believe that not only have they themselves had an opportunity to grow and travel and also been an example to others. I think Mr. Rhodes, also known as Clark Oklahoma, has done a great job of being one such example among his people. So, funny enough, YouTube has it all over here. So, Amarin 2019 was my first ever Disney experience. And I got sort of like into this thing via Instagram. And one day I'm going through my Instagram stories back when I have been, and I see him post a photo on his story, and he's like, oh, this is like my Amarin student. I forget exactly who it was. And I just sort of like, I don't know, I'm like, you know, by this time I'd watched everything that Amarin put out, but it was still on YouTube. And so I was like, oh, you're going to Amarin? Yeah. Well, can I go to Amarin, then?"
1110,P1000364.MP4," He is the book editor of the Occidental Quarterly, and he is the author of Sexual Utopia in Power. And today he's gonna speak on a subject that I think is badly neglected. I'm very much looking forward to his insights on this subject. It's the role of envy in racial conflict. Please welcome F. Roger Dunford. Thank you, Jared. Thank you, Jared. Thank you, Jared. Thank you, Jared. Thank you."
1111,P1000365.MP4," Even before I begin, I imagine most of you have probably sensed at one time or another that envy does play a role in racial conflict. Many writers have alluded to this in passing, but I have never seen a thematic discussion."

Among the Dohu Islanders of Melanesia, for example, any man who farms more yams than his neighbor is thought to have stolen them, usually through black magic. People will not admit the possibility that a man might be eating better than his neighbor because he has put in more honest work than filling his yam field. All prosperity is caused by the deprivation of others. The result, of course, is a general fear of growing abundant food and an entire society kept at the level of bears."

1118,P1000372.MP4," And yet black children are perfectly capable of imagining this. Whites are not preoccupied with comparing themselves to blacks. They are far more likely to compare themselves with other whites. American Renaissance, as you all know, has enemies. A lot of people would like nothing better than to shut us down by force. Most of these people have little idea of what actually gets discussed here. They've never gone to the trouble to find out. The visceral anger they express toward our generally friendly and mild-mannered attendees and writers usually amounts to the accusation, you think you are better. They imagine we go to the trouble of having these meetings in order to congratulate ourselves on our superiority and pour out contempt on the rest of the human race. But do any of you actually know a white person who would repeatedly travel hundreds of miles for that? To state the obvious, our purpose in discussing IQ, for example, is not to pat ourselves on the back, but to refute the notion that we are conspiring to keep other people down. Equality of natural endowments is not something in our power or anyone's power to grant. Natural selection is an impersonal process that from the human point of view scarcely differs from chance. But, as we mentioned earlier, there are primitive societies which altogether lack any concept of impersonal chance or love. They view all differences between man as the result of intentional... Oh dear, sorry about that, Jared. As the result of intentional action, usually of a magical character, some similar superstition probably underlies the thinking of our enemies. Let's see, I'll skip a paragraph. It sometimes occurs to me that the biggest problem with the idea of racial equality is that whites are the only people who can be made to believe in it. The resentment so often evinced toward whites arises deep in the limbic part of the brain and thus remains uninfluenced by egalitarian exhortation, which only operates at the more superficial level of the cortex and rational thought. That is why decades of efforts have done so little to assuage feelings of racial inferiority. So, to conclude, what can be done to combat ending? This is not an easy question. If we look to our own tradition of ethical thought, developed over many centuries within Christendom, we find it to be characterized as a sin, as one of the seven cardinal sins, upon which most more specific sins hinge. Sin is an essentially spiritual phenomenon, which means, among other things, that it must be combated at the individual level. There is no possible political or legislative..."
1119,P1000373.MP4," direct incitements to envy, such as critical race theory, from the environment. Also, as previously noted, distance can diminish the effects of envy, but under a regime of forced and micromanaged associations, this is especially difficult to achieve. But perhaps the most important lesson for us to learn is the futility of appeasement. As Helmut Schurk observes, people who find themselves the targets of envy have difficulty responding rationally. In particular, they are prone to imagine that envy arises as a direct consequence of their being better off, and will therefore necessarily wane if even unrealistic demands are pandered to. American Renaissance has run countless stories about racial pandering, as you know. Repulsive as it is, a certain amount might be tolerable if it were actually effective. But in the long run, it never is. As noted, envious people often get worse the better they are treated. The more generous we are in benefiting the envious, the more clearly we demonstrate, in their eyes, our own superiority. The best we can do is probably to insist upon two truths. This is the end. The best we can do is probably to insist upon two truths. That any advantages we may enjoy are not the cause of others being deprived of them, and that the future of other racial groups is in their own hands, not ours. Thank you. I was going to go too fast and have to answer a lot of questions, but it has to work out that way. But I'll be happy to answer any questions individually. Thank you very much. It was quite a fascinating talk. And our next speaker, Peter Villalon, is a friend of many years, very much a scholar of our movement. I believe he has been the impresario and major domo of VDARE for 22 years now. And insofar as VDARE is fortified by impregnable walls in West Virginia, I suspect it will be good for another 100 years. We're counting on that. Now, staunch as Peter Villalon is, I must tell you that there are deep political differences between him and myself. And I will illustrate this by quoting to you from our Wikipedia entries. My Wikipedia entry states, right in the first sentence, Jared Taylor is a white supremacist. In Peter Villalon's case, you have to get to the second sentence. And there it says, he is the founder of a website that is merely associated with white supremacists. Sounds like weak stuff to me. I'm going to have to have some fun when there's whites in the country. In any case, it's a great pleasure to have you here with us today. And Peter Villalon will speak to us about the midterms, what they mean for us. Please welcome Peter Villalon. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'm delighted to be here. I really have to congratulate Jared and his crew on their heroic struggle against the state of Tennessee to legal struggles in which they ultimately prevailed. This question of de-platforming, indirect de-platforming through the state's alliance with the left, and its refusal to protect us, is a key issue that we're all having to face. I'd also like to thank Roger for running over and just giving me more time to think about what I had to say."

1121,P1000375.MP4," All right, go ahead. All right, so it's Saturday morning. The conference has officially started. We've heard a couple of the speakers already. It's about 10 o'clock now, and we have no sign of any of the counter-protesters. This here is the area where they were supposed to be gathering, and no sign of them. I'm not sure if it's too cold out or if they've slept in or something, but no sign. Everything is going very well inside of the venue here, so we're going to go back in and check out some of the speakers."
1122,P1000376.MP4," I'm trying to like panning shots just okay, but you might have better zoom And that would be so cool if there was just an angry mob that they're yelling yeah, hell yeah"

And that kid can't control where the hell he's going to be born to, but we can control, we can try to teach better behavior of the people that are currently living, not to do that kind of crap, and not to, you know, just erase things. But I understand, at the end of the day, children are always being born. It's not their fault where they're born to, it's their parents' fault."
1125,P1000379.MP4," They were saying something like, we're not actually here for these guys inside. Is there any way we can get in? To do what? Exactly. They've got to be fucked, that's what they're saying. Yeah. Oh man, I got that on video. You did? Yeah. I wonder if it's like, you know, they have the check point up there to stop people from coming down here if they're not supposed to be here, but if they just walk across the bridge here, I wonder if maybe the police don't have the kind of authority or whatever to like, you know, just to kick people out. They can stop them from coming in, but not, you know. So they just came up, they're like, we're not, we want to come in, we're not here for the thing, and here, well, we actually, we actually, we came for a drink. We actually, we don't even know what's going on there, but we're not there for them, you know. Keep it rolling. Mm-hmm. How's it going? Fine. You guys here for the conference? Yeah."

Alright, so our friends have just shown up. The counter-protesters are now being corralled into place over here. There's a small handful of them. One's yelling on a loudspeaker.

I've written about him before. So, would you care to comment on what you guys are here doing today? You already know. Well, we want a comment from you, man. You heard it. Come on, you can give me more than that. I don't like you. Oh, that's fine. I'm just here to get your opinion. That's as good as it's going to get, baby. Come on, Darryl. I know you like to talk. I know I like to talk, but I don't like to talk to Fash. Well, I don't like to talk. What do you think is the percentage of chance of people not showing up to the event today due to your presence? I don't think there is any percentage of that, and I couldn't care less. We're not here for that. This is not where the fun begins. What are you here for? Like I said, I do not want to compensate. There is no compensation. Oh, come on, Darryl. There is no compensation. So, Graham, how was Philly for you? I heard his voice on the TV. I voiced it. I think that's what Graham has to say. I mean, Graham, Graham, Graham. He was in Cook Road, I believe, recently, and not long ago. Philly wasn't out on TV yet. Philly wasn't out on TV yet. Philly wasn't out on TV yet. Philly wasn't on TV yet. Philly, I mean, I don't think they're here. I don't think they're here because you two are here. I think they're here because you're on TV. And that's the reason you're playing the drums. I'm talking about you, Jimmy Fallon. This is for a piece of you. Oh, my mistake. What did you think of the original one? I can't answer for you, I can't read. Whatever. You guys are going to make it work. I know, I know. I'm going to do the same. That's not how it works. You're going to do the mouth drop? You're going to do it? I'm going to do it. Oh, I see. You're not in the band. You're not in the band. I'm in the band. You're in the band. Do you have any comments on the official? I'm curious, is Rob here? Oh, I see. Oh, I see. I'm going to get you. There is an image. Oh, I see. Hi, Jimmy Fallon. Hi, Jimmy Fallon. Hi, Jimmy Fallon. Hi, Jimmy Fallon. Wow. This is James and Andy. This is James and Andy. Hi, Jimmy Fallon. Hi, Jimmy Fallon. Hi, Jimmy Fallon. All your leaders here. I'm not the final boss. I'm not the final boss. This is not a video game. Do you have any comments on the anti-stash dirty? The place where they're stealing the documentary. The torture of people. I will not comment on any of that. Not to you. That is my personal concern. That is my concern. I'm a journalist. You're a propagandist. You're a videographer. So you don't have any comments on the anti-fascist Gordon. I will not comment on the anti-fascist Gordon to you. Have you released any statement? I will not release any statement to you. I'm asking if you've released a statement. I'm not going to release it to you. I'm asking if you've released a statement. I wish you good luck. Get the fuck out of here. I wish you good luck. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. It's kind of a steep walk. It's kind of a steep walk going up this hill. Be careful going up. It's a good walk. It's a good walk. You said you don't want to say anything about... I don't know. I don't know. Darryl, can I get a selfie? You want to take a selfie? Darryl, can I get a selfie? Rob! Cops! Why are you letting the fascists out here? You've got us blocked off and you're letting the fascist cops harass us? We want them out of here now! We want them out of here now, David, or we're coming up with a fucking barrier! Get the fascists out of a protest area! You want to block it off? Block it the fuck off! How much time do you spend on your mustache, man? It's a waste of time, whatever it was. Yeah, yeah, fuck you all. Get the fuck out! Why are they letting them down here? Why are the cops letting them down here? Why are the cops letting them down here? Why are the cops letting them down here? Why are the cops letting them down here? Why are the cops letting them down here? You're pathetic! What are you all, fascist cops? You're scared little boys. You're scared little boys. And you think this is funny because you're fucking spoiled little shits. That's all you are. We know what's said. Tennessee police are on. The park rangers. Protect the fascists. Keep protecting them. I'm not afraid to be seen. I know. Take my picture. I don't give a fuck. I'm fine with my picture taken. I'm fine with my picture taken. You already did it, motherfucker. You know it. How about that guy in the mask? What's your face, bitch? Let's not talk about pictures not being taken when this guy is wearing a mask and you guys are anti-vax. I gave you a chance to speak and you didn't want to speak. I didn't tell you what you wanted me to say. You're allowing a confrontation to start. You need to get them off the fucking bridge. Alright guys, have a nice day. Be careful on the steep walk up here. Darryl, you especially. We'll see you guys later. Be careful with the drive-by. See you soon, Graham. Oh, what a bunch of clowns. Yes, you are. I hope we got some good audio of that guy just mouth-breathing into the mic. Keep that rolling. I'm going to ask these cops something. Get a little piece. What's that? You be my gram. You recording? Alright, so here we are on the bridge. As you can see, the barricade is stopping the zoo over here. They're not wanting to be very vocal about what they're doing here, which is odd because that's what they came here to do. But, uh, we tried. And then we keep going up to the cops. I wonder how they don't have an answer to that. Because they know it's true. They're really pathetic insecure. They're really trying to prove their worth. They're just doing what they can find to do. You know this? They're really pathetic. I'm sorry you guys have to hear that. Alright, I'm going to head up."
1131,P1000385.MP4," Were they somebody? Yeah, I think they knew. Oh, that's good. No, it's good to get them on the record. It's a good solution. So you didn't try to talk to anybody else? No, I first tried to talk to Darryl and the others were just kind of playing music over the loud horns and pretty much interrupting us. So, we didn't get much of an open door. At least you got some footage of the crowd. Were they bellowing? Oh yeah. Very good. We need them to do their thing. They got a reputation to live up. It's the Amron fan club, right? A little while ago, Thomas, right before the show, was like, I'm about to start a protest, a protest, a lack of protesting here. I gotta get back to work. Alrighty."
1132,P1000386.MP4," Where's he at now? Probably got to go sit down somewhere. Get maybe another little snippet here. Good, rolling. Alright, so we're back up here at the conference venue, and the protesters, I think they're a little tired after what just happened. They've stopped their screaming, Darryl is sitting down, a lot of them are sitting down. They're just kind of hanging out now. They're probably wishing they were inside the conference to hear the speakers. They're having a wonderful time inside, so we're going to jump back in and participate with the speakers and the crowd."
1133,P1000387.MP4, They seem quite content.

1135,P1000389.MP4," as alternatives or substitutes to Twitter and Facebook and Google. But I think there's something beyond that. And all you have to do is look at sort of the dustbin of past Silicon Valley giants like MySpace or Digg that have just gone to the wayside or just disappeared. And I think that's where we're headed because, of course, these Silicon Valley technocrats, they've always overreached. They're very arrogant and hubristic. And so I think from this glut of these alternatives, there will rise something that we haven't even conceived of. And then the other thing I think that's really important is, conversely, people are now relying more on sort of the 19th century message. I'm not a carrier pigeon yet, but text messages and just on-the-ground organizing that is completely out of the sphere of the Internet. That certainly has been the case with so many of these parents who are now on Fox News every night. Well, 10 or 15 years ago, when they were ignored by Fox News because they were going against the Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Common Core agenda, those parents 10 or 15 years ago were..."
1136,P1000390.MP4," You have big figures in the government, lots of politicians and other media commentators over the years. Do you believe that their beliefs are sincerely held or is there just a lot of grifting involved with conservative leadership? The grift is big, for certain. But I should just say as a caveat or caution that, again, thinking of what Roger Dettlin said about envy, that often will huddle the view of a lot of people who assume motivations and assumptions. And at this point, really all you can do is look at someone's records. You can't read people's minds, but what you can do is look at the revealed preferences.

And so you've got all of these woke Asian elites that I've talked about who purport to speak for the kinds of immigrants that you're speaking of. And so there's this huge wedge, there's this huge sort of grand canyon-sized gap between the interests of the woke Asians, right, and the interests of Asians who should be having a common cause with people in this room. And to the extent that I can help bring people along on that, I definitely will. And that raises a point too about"

1139,P1000393.MP4, Recording. So let's go down and turn this hallway into a place where we're going through a maze to find the man with the hour. And that should be good.
1140,P1000394.MP4, Thank you.
1141,P1000395.MP4, I can email you when the film is done. I have your email. Thank you very much Mr. Taylor. Bye bye. Hello. What's the time now?
1142,P1000396.MP4," All right, Mr. Taylor. So Amarin was founded in 1990 and your first conference was in 1994. Can you first tell us a little bit about the formula of years between then? Golly. Well, Amarin was started off as a print publication. It was a monthly journal. And we never had more than about 3,500 subscribers. That included, in the later years, a PDF version. But the Internet changed everything for us. To the point when we switched over, I guess it was about 2012. Since that point, we've gotten to the point where we get a million different visitors to the website in a month. So, starting as a print publication, moving to the Internet, that's really stretched our voice. As far as the first conference, yes, that was 1994. That was quite an undertaking. I didn't have anybody working for me. It was really hard work getting it going. But it was a great success. People were just starving. White people with some sense of their own destiny and their own heritage were just starving for an opportunity to get together. And once that demand was met, we just kept going. That's the way we've had it ever since. So, AmRen wasn't originally founded to host conferences. It just sort of happened? That's right. That's right. And, as a matter of fact, we got a recommendation to hold a conference with one of our readers. And then another reader said, okay, it's a financial risk, obviously. You're going to rent these facilities. You're going to pay for speakers to come in. You may not get enough folks to cover it. I will underwrite it to the tune of, I think at that time it was $5,000. I'll pick up any $5,000 loss you have. Well, it turned out to be a small profit. People were prepared to come. As I say, there was a real thirst for an opportunity to get together with fellow racially conscious white people and talk about our own interests. What was the kind of turnout from the first event compared to what we're seeing today? The first event was probably about 85 people. I believe it was under 100. Now, we have gone as high as 400. That was back when we were able to meet in hotels, close to airports, where we could process credit cards, when the opposition was not nearly as fierce as it is now. Less obstacles. Fewer obstacles. At the time, things evolved, really. We started off having conferences in nice weather, and then we realized that that attracted protesters."
1143,P1000397.MP4," These, I think they called us Nazis, we're going to go in there and shoot you. Well that is a kind of a threat that a hotel can hardly ignore. Clearly, the chances of it's happening are very, very low. But if something like that did happen, and there hadn't been a warning of that kind, the hotel would be in a terrible situation. So it became impossible for us to have a conference in a private hotel. So we're meeting here in Tennessee State."
1144,P1000398.MP4, attendance today what do you want them taking home I want to murder Minnesotans confidence to do something that inspires quite to work courageously and in a dedicated way to their own interests what am I great I'm a great fan of guillaume fine and he said some time ago if the generation that's in their 20s now it's not that they won't be another generation of white people I think that's true white people are in a race against time unless we wake up unless we are determined to grasp this opportunity we're going to be shoved aside and I think at the very best we will be facing of living at the very worst we will be facing the kind of oppression see of whites in South Africa today as we become minority and a country becomes wrong but people who increasingly obviously not only will I take out of our hands our fate will be in the hands of people who hold mouths against us and that is no future to leave torture so what do you get to take home on these events I get to take home the sense of trying to do my I've been doing this for 30 years and it is very gratifying what people do tell me that the things that I've said and done I've helped them understand the faith that we face and so that is the satisfaction that I get out of as I say doing what I see to be my duty and I ask all white people racially conscious white people likewise to do their duty because if they do not then we face it what factors influence your opinion on the future of white identity politics there are many things that go into that one is the reaction of those who oppose it one of the benefits of Trump was that he caused the front lines become so clearly drawn the absolute hatred for him despite the fact that he was not by any means a racial nationalist despite the fact that I don't think he thinks really in racial terms much at all but the fact that he did not count on to this notion of white guilt and that the multi-culti paradise is just a few pieces of legislation away that made him the equivalent of a white supremacist or a Nazi so the extent to which the left was brought out of its lair and made to show its fangs in the most unambiguous way that was a very important thing about the last few years increasingly also when you have blacks and to some extent Hispanics and hopped up white people talking about just how awful and miserable white people are the idea that we are the hereditary inherent oppressors of everyone else there are going to be some white people who believe this and hang their heads in shame but the more they're told that some people are saying hold on this is crazy and I see more and more young white Americans who from grade school they've been told how awful and they are hopping man and they deserve and I just hope and for most part it's true they are taking this anger
1145,P1000399.MP4," People who says worse is better. The more things go wrong, the better things will end up. But it is certainly true that since 2020, with this heightened assertion of the inherent evil of white, this really is driving people into our arms. So, on the one hand, the more crazy and extreme the other side gets, the more people are forced to join us. And that is a good thing. What we'll be able to accomplish, that's really up to everyone else in our movement. I like to think that it's really a matter of numbers. Eventually, when enough white people think the way we do, things will change in ways we can't even anticipate. We don't know what will happen. We don't know who the really heroic people who create a space for us. We don't even know their names yet."
1146,P1000400.MP4," saying and taking the actions we're taking, all of this will follow."
1147,P1000401.MP4, realm of political thought dissident thought maybe what would what advice would you give them the advice that I would give is don't forget that this is likely to be a long fight so don't go out like a cop in a blaze you don't have to be the great Aryan warrior thumping your chest not from the start what I tell all young people ask me that question is get an education find a good woman and make a family establish yourself and then if you have skills contribute them to the movement if you make money contribute them to the movement as our movement grows some young people will be able to spend full time working for our people but don't go out in a blaze don't do something that burns all your bridges immediately as soon as you realize just how crazy everything you've been told is you have to be sober about this intelligent we are a race that's supposed to be a deferred gratification we plan we build on things and so the first thing that you have to do as a responsible white man is to build your own professional credentials build your own family and then move from there then there are many many directions in which you can go but that is the first thing you must do so we cover a lot of activism groups given your kind of decades of experience what would you say you know groups like yours compared to activism groups could learn from each other well I don't really have much to teach activists I've never really been an activist I think you can know I wouldn't say that I'd say you're an activist but maybe more street level activism yes I I'm not the kind of guy who does organize rallies to me they're really two different stages and they can work simultaneously one is education and the other is politics or activism and I'm always I've always been one who is interested in ideas and changing people's minds other people have a talent for running for office or for organizing batter drops or mass meetings that kind of thing my mind just doesn't move in that direction and I'm so glad that there are other people whose minds do move in that direction one thing that I am convinced is that increasingly as the shrillness of the attacks on whites not it'll be more and more possible for white people to run for local office there's absolutely no reason why that should not be happening now for County Commission City Council school you can have a big impact simply money and some of these offices you could probably win that is an important kind of activism again I am NOT in a position to tell people how to run their own form of activism I'm in the business of trying to change people's minds in an intellectual way and that's I believe for my talents life
1148,P1000402.MP4," So last year's conference was canceled due to COVID health concerns. Does that place additional weight on the importance of this year's event? Yes, in a sense it did. And it made it a little bit more difficult because there are still lingering concerns about COVID. And the requirement of a COVID vaccine for European travelers to the United States made it impossible for two of our fellows to show up. It's really very sad. And there are some people who hesitate to come because of COVID as well. So Amarin has weathered state repression, media slander, and opposition violence. You yourself have assumed a great deal of personal risk having these events. Why? It's what we must do. And when you think about it, compared to people who were trying to bring about a revolution in the past, to the people who wanted to bring about the Russian Revolution, I think that was an absolute catastrophe. But those were brave, dedicated men. We don't face anything like the challenges they face. And so you can say, oh, he's been deplatformed, he lost his job. These things are bad, but it's not like a bullet in the back of your head. These are some of the challenges that other people who wanted to change the world face. We live in a kind of soft totalitarianism. We don't get hauled off the grid. Not yet. We don't get just cut down by the czars' men with their saber-wielding cassocks. That doesn't happen. That could happen, but it hasn't happened yet. And the sacrifices that people say they have made, or they think they may have to make, I don't think they're nearly as great as some of them are. Losing your job is a terrible thing, and your family, all these things are very bad. But for the great rewards of having turned my back on all of that conventional stuff is the wonderful people that I've met. That is the great thing about becoming a dissident in a noble cause, is you meet other dissidents in this noble cause. And you find people who know more about it than you do, who have more experience than you do, who can teach you things, but who are your brothers in a way that people who do not agree with us are not. So there are great personal rewards. And I think if we do things carefully, do things soberly, we can build institutions that are self-sustaining in a financial way, so that if you do lose your job, then there are other places where we can work. Other people, other people who have companies, there are sacrifices that don't mean a downplay. But if we are intelligent about how we approach this work, these are all tolerable sacrifices, and they are nothing compared to what revolutionaries in the past have had to go through."
1149,P1000403.MP4," press interest. The idea of course was to tell the American public, look at this revolting racist, this terrible Jared Taylor, he supports Donald Trump. Donald Trump must be a racist too. This was hammered, hammered, hammered in a way that gave me an astonishing amount of publicity. Television, newspaper, that's all died down because they can no longer use me to try to smear Donald Trump. I think though that this is part of a very strange media dynamic. They didn't really understand what they were doing. They convinced themselves that because someone like me supports Donald Trump, Donald Trump thinks everything that I do, which is absurd and ridiculous. But by the time they were elected, they had in their idea, they created this Frankenstein monster of a fraudling white supremacist Donald Trump and they were stuck with it. Of course by then, they with this remarkable capacity to see white supremacy and racism everywhere, had convinced themselves that he was just as bad as they imagined him to be. But this was the relationship that we had with that political ferment at that time. When we had a conference in 2016 before the election, there really was a sense that the United States was changing."
1150,P1000404.MP4," galvanizing white people in a way that they have not been galvanized in a long time. I hate to have to confess that although it is a defensive move, the reactions of ordinary white parents to CRT, critical history in schools, is one of the first times that white people in decades have stood up and said, well, hold on, and they're acting in their own interests. This is a very important thing. It's not something that whites, as they usually do, have meekly accepted, okay, okay, we're bad, we're bad. No, they're actually standing up and saying, the hell with this, and voting out school boards. That's a very important psychological breakthrough for white people to act in their own interests, even if it is in a defensive way. We have to take that momentum and move it forward, demanding our rights, demanding the ability to express a preference for our people, the rights to associate with ourselves. All of that can perhaps build on this anti-CRT movement. That's a wrap. Okay. Can I ask one additional question? Maybe you can ask it after I ask it. So, you are obviously a very well-known figure, especially in the sphere of dissident politics and white identity discussions in general. Either topics directly relate to things you say and ideas you've either started or helped to popularize, or they are only one or two degrees of separation away. American Renaissance is one of the most tenured conference histories of the... We've been at it a long time. You have. And there's a lot of people out there and a lot of people look to you as a very prominent thought leader. People look to you for answers, and stuff has been happening in history. I want to know more introspectively, how do you deal with or respond to the pressures of this leadership position that you have? Well, one thing I can tell you... Now, should I be looking... Which way should I be looking? To Luke. One thing I can tell you is that I am delighted to see groups and organizations cropping up completely independently of American Renaissance. There was a time when it seemed that every group that got going was run by people that I knew. Nowadays, it's either the media companies or this media company or political parties. They start... And I had nothing to do with it. At least, nothing directly to do with it. And I don't like to flatter myself and think that it wouldn't happen if I had been doing what I was doing."
1151,P1000405.MP4," Speak on the way that future leaders of the movement go through AmRen conferences. AmRen is kind of a passage point for those things. I think we kind of see that. Maybe you don't know these people personally, but I think that they know people that you know. They've come from things that have sprouted from people who have once been here at these conferences. That's very gratifying. So I think you play a very big part in a lot of new things growing. Maybe that's the case, but I'm very, very gratified by the, especially young people coming along. I'll tell you a story about my generation. It used to be when I'd go to meetings, everybody there was just a little bit peculiar."

I guess they seemed to think that they didn't make much of an impact and they packed it up and went home. They tried, but they failed. We're having a blast, we're going to go back in and see who's speaking next."

Apparently, every moment when we are not vowing black lives matter, the top of our lungs were somehow committed violence. Even in our sleep, sparks ignite. What this means is all whites are guilty. And of what are we guilty? We're guilty of being white. And that's where Columbus comes in. Columbus is the origin of the evil, because he was the first to bring this terrible plague of whiteness to the entire western nation. And that's why everything that has happened since 1492 is nothing more than one long series of crimes for which we are all guilty. And so those..."

They are saving us from the suffocating sameness that makes being in this room so uncomfortable. There's really not much that makes me angry than some Indian, some dot, immigrant from India, who tells me how glad we white people should be that those folks showed up. They act as if we should get on our knees and kiss their feet and just say, thank you, thank you, thank you for diversity. This is actually happening. Can you imagine going to China and saying to the Chinese, you know, not a bad country, but there's one thing really wrong with it. Too damn many Chinese. You need to liven the place up with anything you like. Eskimos, that'd be great. New Guineans with feather in their hands. Afghans, Haitians, they'll really get this country going.

1167,P1000441.MP4," this country and look me in the eye and tell me that it had to be this way. No, no, no, no, no, no. This far and no further. This stops. This stops here. This stops now. This stops with us. And the fact is, I am not telling you to dodge yourself or charge the guns. I've seen a lot of good people hurt badly because they naively thought that this was a fair system. That's not how this works. I am not telling you to jeopardize your family or necessarily your job. But what I am telling you is that it is the nature of the system to create new grievances and new problems. There's no point where this goes so far and then it collapses in upon itself. There's no point where it becomes so absurd that it just stops. Because people are rewarded for creating new grievances. Think of what's happening right now on social media, online, in culture, in law. If you hadn't explained that to somebody five years ago, you'd be locked away. And they'd be right to do it. But here we are. Now imagine what it's going to be like five years from now if we don't do anything. You don't get to opt out of this. They're coming for you. They're coming for everything. And they are not going to stop until you, we, stop them. And that means that wherever you are right now, you have a moral obligation, you have a duty to do what you can. Maybe that means donating. Maybe that means helping friends find a job. Maybe that means setting up a group in your community. Maybe that means stepping forward under your name and doing stuff and writing and organizing and running for office. There are a million ways people can do something. And that's a topic for another day. But most of all, you have to do something. You know, one of the things that was put on social media a while back, it didn't catch on, but I kind of liked it, was this idea of"

1173,P1070091.MP4," America is dead, long live America. America is a bleeding carcass bereft of the moral foundations which made it powerful. The America of modernity is the economic zone in which the dollar is used to ratify culture that no longer exists due to internationalized migration. A powerful morality no longer exists due to the steady erosion of the history of nation."
1174,P1070092.MP4," Nothing about the current system is sustainable. The nation moves on, not through the marble halls, the state, or the rivers, or the mountains of the country, but in the hearts of the determined. Within these faithful fears, the true inheritance of the nation carries on. The form of being our true nation will be something that is rooted firmly in the natural laws that bind humanity to the reason. They are the very same laws which led civilizations to ruin if they are ignored. In this sense, no temporary solutions will show themselves to be an option. No half-truths or compromises can lead to peace. Man cannot and should not define the laws of nature. The world in which he does grows increasingly nightmarish. The life of the average American will change during this transition. It will be a great change, a change that will infuse struggle in his soul. He will emerge on the other side of this great national upheaval as a new man, a stronger, more dedicated servant to his people, and a staunch protector of his defender and his family. He will no longer know the age and material of illness, of disunity. His neighbors will fit the term in more than just normal fashion. He will be removed from the decadence and given community. He will be protected from barbarism and given responsibility. His nation will be extended family, not a land of strangers where once a people stood, he can no longer be sold a life that will never come. A life of working is something that is neither rewarding nor spiritually beneficial. Turmoil will give way to stability as the sun rises in the new American nation state. He will see himself in his government, and his government in the face of all his efforts. His life will now actually be a walk in the park, a stroll in the woods, and a song. But like this, as an individual and as a member of the greater collective, with both servants who edify each other, he will be an inseparable member of the global natural state."
1175,P1070093.MP4," Individualism, while originally good in concept and proposition, has been allowed to run rampant in our modern society, where it has become a plague in its amplification. The nation of the future will not abolish the individual, nor will it rudely state for us a sole collective. A marriage must be structured to complement one another. Every man exists as a member of several collectives, and of these collectives, a select few identities have strategically been stripped from our people's sense of self. You are a member of a family, community, a nation, and a race beyond that. These are the natural classifications that have been given to all men, young and old, rich and poor. Only by the encroaching rot of internationalization have these ties been weakened, and in many cases, ultimately broken down. Alongside this, many have been so bereft of these invaluable aspects of their identity that they have been led to hate themselves and their people, and even view their prevalence as detrimental to one's well-being. Law is often but the tyrant's will. Thomas Jefferson said that. However, it must be noted that you exist as an individual, and you do so in accordance with your family, community, nation, and race. You must never exist in spite of them, to see yourself solely as an individual is misguided and lacks an ethical basis. Your actions are not your own, in the sense that they almost always are."
1176,P1070094.MP4," Every group has a common interest in the form of survival, prosperity, and progress. What we see illustrated so well in our current age is also the prevalence of collective threats. In order to survive as a culture, a heritage, and a way of being, our nation must learn that its collective interests are fighting against its collective threats of displacement and enslavement. In times of turmoil such as we find ourselves in, the dominant motto and tones of our people must shape themselves into a single, unified voice. Through their unity and through their civilizational focus on a set of ideals and goals, human accomplishment will grow to its full potential. The great question of our civilization has only occupied itself with asking. Asking has been how one can achieve the greatest amount of personal pleasure. The rise in this question of privacy and the collective unconscious of our people has correlated exactly with our decline. Our people and our civilization should occupy themselves with asking the question of privacy. The question that goes to the proper balance between society and the world. I'm responding to what man, what man makes a man of words. Jackson. Humans are social creatures. We are social beings. We are social beings. We are social beings. We are social beings.

The previous era has been spent diluting the definition of what an American is. The coming era will refine the definition of an American to the American people. Our movement is revolutionary yet familiar. We bring forth the traditions of our past imbued with new vigor to bring us closer to our grand vision, our tradition."
1178,P1070097.MP4," The prevailing order instills and seeks to make unquestionable the value of a lifestyle where a man is turned into an oyster. They seek to make men stationary, sedentary, to forbid them to the experience that their youth offers, and make them blind and untrusting to that which they can see with their own eyes. There was never a revolution composed of the obese. There was never a revolution composed of the lazy and the content. Organizing, activism, resistance, and idealism provide the great antidote to the only seeming alternative that is submission and slavery. Action necessitates that one travel and learn and gather compatriots to their cause who will then become brothers in their efforts and their lives. Activism gives a voice to the common man. Extra politics conceives of a way... I think you skipped a page. I did? Yeah. Here we go. Yeah, there you go."

What we created is not just a tradition and a nation is not rewarded, but one wherein it is necessary to remain here. To make the map, to make a nation, you must first show them what it is to be one. The truth about our future that is beyond reproach is that if we are to be a free people, it will be by the labors of our nation's men that it will be so."

National sovereignty must be exercised by a state. But sovereignty itself must be bestowed by the people of the people. All governments that stand in righteous conduct must bear the nation's will upon their structure. It is made beyond obvious by every infinitesimal small deed of our state that this is not the case. Thus, the proven grounds of legitimacy lay open, yet not undisturbed. The rising space wherein the true rulers of the people, government or not, will grow and grow downlessly, so long as the state leaves untended its natural duties. We must assume that it will. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to organize fanatically in pursuit of a truly rooted and foundational politics which raises up the common man as his own instrument of liberation against fear."

Henry, do you have your jacket? My jacket is in that bag somewhere. I just want to show you how to talk. Yes. You want to show him how the package goes? Yes. So, once you get your package, the guns... This is allowed to be worn, but it's not the official what you're wearing. This is a PF patch. This right here. You can buy those.

1190,P1070120.MP4," You're ready to put on the sleeve. Don't zip up the jacket. Fold it over. Kind of center it so that it's perfectly rectangular. Fold the sleeves in like that so that you can still see the patches. But keep that rectangular shape. Do the other side. So that now you have a nice rectangular... pretty much the width of the hood. Now what you do... you roll really tight from the bottom in. So you keep rolling. You pull. Kind of like a... a VHS. Once you have it rolled right up to the base of the hood... Keep the hood up. Yup. And then what you do is you tuck in... the sides. Do one more good tight roll. And you take the hood. You put each side of the hood over each side. You roll it into the hood. That's awesome. Now, there should be a strap on the back of the hood. You take that, stretch it out as much as you can. And it goes right through the hood. But I know the real Kondor ones do. But that's okay because you're going to put your mask over it. So if you have a Kondor jacket... and it has a strap on the hood... you pull the strap over. And that keeps it nice and secure. Then what you do... you take off your hat and your mask. You put your mask right over your jacket. Then you take the patches off your hat. You slip them under the mask. And you put the hat right over the whole conglomeration. That way you have a nice tight roll... that's what it looks like when you look at it. And it conserves all the space so you can fit more materials in there. That's it."

1275,P1080071.MP4," No more working grades, no more students getting a 4.0 degree. Check this fuck out. They think this is a failure. Today is a failure because this is pathetic. We're only playing 200."
1276,P1080073.MP4," We, the people, born to a nation of our European race, whose ancestors chose a new world despite an ancient tyranny. We, the people, whose forefathers created a proud lineage, a new identity, a sovereign state. We, the people, refuse to surrender our rights to our future. The countless ranks of America's honored dead, those who chose martyrdom or for compliance with evil, will not let us step aside. We will win because we are whole. We will hold fast to our roots against the storm of imperialistic rage and live in rage because those born to the service of injustice may be among the people, but they are not of the people. Every day that passes is one less that the petty despots have to surrender themselves to virtue before history comes crashing down around them. We put our efforts against those who place feeble justice in the hands of a tempestuous mob. Of would-be warlords and useful idiots. And a political class of manipulators with no legitimate claims on our American nation. The halls of government have been smashed open wide for all to see. And we have seen that there is nothing sacred within, nothing that gives them the right over us any longer. The responsibility of government. Reclaim America! Reclaim America! Reclaim America! Reclaim America! Reclaim America! The responsibility of government has been returned to the hands of the people. We will defend what is ours because it is our work that has built it. Our ancestors' toil was not given so the fruits of their labor would be granted to the extra-national. He who is born in heart, mind and body. All the world's demon rescues are crowded into our cities. And in exchange, our posterity is cut down in the streets like animals. Sacrifice, not silence, paves the way to freedom. Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! We have raised a shield in defense of our nation's creed. And we owe it to ourselves, to the hardships of resistance. Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! One, two, three, shut the fuck up! Again! Keep it up! Keep it up! Shut up! It is a repugnant reality in which we are just guilty of being born as we are. We are not hating ourselves and our kids for refusing to die when the state dictates the time is right. Even with all the money they can win from the hands of the people, they cannot afford the price of our lives. Who the fuck is that has the fucking stand in front of the camera? Fuck you! What we seek is nothing less than a new American nation-state. A republic composed of the very people for which it stands. A revolutionary collective of the nation which will deliver us from interminable greed and spoiler, intolerable injustice and suppression. While this world may be distant, its seeds are sown today. To those who can witness disaster and pledge no action in reply, to hear patriotism end in the bird box or behind the screen, we say this. We would not taint our cause with your treasonous lack of conviction. Kneel and beg the tyrants for that mercy which they will deny you. May you wear your chains gracefully and may it be forgotten that you were ever a countryman. The land between our marching ranks is sovereign. America is free between the footfalls of patriots. Where we go, we break boundaries. They open up a new path for liberty granted to all people. Every day all of us are starting to remind her to know who her responsibility is and to kill these scum. We are not a government office or state legislature but of our people's refusal to yield. Every day all of us are starting to remind her to know who her responsibility is and to kill these scum. That they cannot do so and yet be beyond the same anguish that haunts every day of those whom they hold dear our people and forget. On and on they speak of democracy. Let them practice what they preach as we do. Step out from behind the podium, out beyond the police lines. They want our compliance. Come and take it or don't come at all. For the life of our nation. For the liberty of our people. For the victory of the American spirit. Life, liberty, victory. Reclaim America!"

1330,PATRIOT_FRONT_In_Washington_DC.mp4," This is Luke Accordiot with Media to Rise kicking off the live updates for today. We are currently in the back of a box truck. There is a caravan of box trucks heading to Washington, D.C. where Patriot Front is going to be marching, demonstrating, and giving some speeches from Thomas Rousseau. Reclaim America! Reclaim America! Right, left, march! Crosswalks to the left. Alright as you can see they've brought the helicopter out. There's tons of police. Thomas, why are we marching in D.C.? Our demonstrations are an exhibition of our unified capability to organize, to show our strength not as brawlers or public nuisances, but as men capable of illustrating a message and seeking an America that more closely resembles the interests of its true people. Life, liberty, victory! Okay guys, we are headed to the Capitol for Thomas to give his speech. We are completely surrounded by an army of police and tons of spectators that are enjoying the show. We are here to replace legal justice in the hands of a tempestuous mob of would-be warlords and youthful idiots."
1331,Patriot_Front_is_a_Globalist_Honey_Pot_operation.mp4," I got quite a bit of backlash from my last video, so I decided to go ahead and double down. I did some more research, uncovered a few more things, and I'm going to post it in this video. This is the CEO of Cloudflare, Matthew Prince. Matthew is a World Economic Forum technology pioneer and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He's also the co-creator of Project Honeypot, which is the largest Honeypot network that uses software embedded in websites to collect information about IP addresses. If you don't know the purpose behind a Honeypot, basically it's a trap designed to target an individual or a group for blackmail, coercion, or to gather information. This globalist Honeypot project has been contracting with our federal agencies for a very long time. They have, on numerous occasions, admitted to hosting terrorist content, including sites that were linked to ISIS, Hamas, the Taliban, and countless neo-Nazi websites. So, please excuse me when I find it a little bit suspicious that the FBI and Patriot Front website both share an IP address that is within Cloudflare's IP range. As always, don't forget to help out your neighbors. Thanks for watching."

1333,Patriot_Front_Marches_Near_The_Capitol._Are_They_A_FED_Front.mp4," Patriot front or federal a front. I can't tell. How's everybody doing? My name is Anthony Brian Logan. And today we got to talk about a group of 200 people called the Patriot front who marched near the Capitol in Washington, DC on Saturday, December the 4th, 2021, who are described as a group of white supremacists and neo Nazis and far right, all of these kinds of derogatory terms. Now, are they those things? I'm not really sure. I can't tell. I don't know if they are legitimately some kind of dangerous group or not, but I will say this matter of fact, I have a question for you guys that are watching. Have you heard them before, before this video, have you heard of Patriot front at any point in time? I'll wait because I've not, not until this whole March thing happened and it came across my Twitter feed. Never seen them before. So if they were so dangerous, if they pose the big threat to national security, surely they would have been mentioned before. Right? I mean, there are certain groups all over the country. We know about that are dangerous. You got like ma Mexican mafia. What's that? Ms. 13 blood scripts, the Italian mafia. You know, even was that the Japanese mafia, whatever they got over there, your Kusa I've heard about these actual groups, right? But never have I heard of Patriot front who apparently have 41 chapters all over the United States. Why is it of a concern to me? Maybe it's because we have the midterms coming up real soon. And I've said this before, right? When midterm elections and definitely 2024 federal national stuff goes on. Oh, you're going to see a lot of these groups come out. You're going to see black lives matter come out because the budget gets released. Okay. You got a big budget. These guys look very well, uh, trained. Everybody's nice and fit. You know, the average person in America is not necessarily fit. You know, they got to exercise and get kind of tight, but these guys appear to look like the, you know, the fitness standards of the federal rallies. Now I'm not saying all these guys are feds. I think what's going on here is that a lot of them are regular normies. Some of them may believe in some, I guess you would say harmful things. And some are going to be feds. Any group like this that is allowed to just persist and they got all these chapters and stuff like that. They're most certainly infiltrated by feds. We saw what the proud boys, we've seen it with other groups. It always is the same thing over and over and over again. The feds are going to be embedded. And then after a while, they'll take them down. And these guys would get football numbers, independent century, 10, 15, 20 years. That's how it goes. The feds know what's going on. They can find you. They can track you. They know what's happening. So if there's anything somewhat illegal going on here, they're going to get locked up. They will not be allowed to persist. The feds are most certainly in that group. I guarantee you, I'm willing to bet all the tea and China on it. Right. But to get back to the whole election thing, we're going to see a lot more this come election time. As we creep closer to the election, closer to 2022 and you start to see the campaigns kick off and get a lot more steam and a lot more cash behind them. We're going to see more of this. And some are going to say, Hey man, take a 10, 4 hat off. These guys are legitimate. Well, we just saw what happened in Charlottesville. We just started with the whole, um, what was it? Not Terry McAuliffe, uh, Glenn Youngkin, you had these three or four more runs with a tiki torch outfits on right by Glenn Youngkin's bus, you know, and then somebody that was right there, a witness asked him, Hey, what's going on? Who are you guys? We're with Glenn. But then later on, um, what was it? Um, Lincoln project, the so-called conservative anti-Trumpers, but ain't nothing but liberal anti-Trumpers. They came out and said, they staged a incident to remind people of the unite the right. And it just so happens that if you look up these people, the Patriot front, they started after you're not in the right rally, right around that same time. There was one group that splintered off. It became two different ones in the Patriot front or one of them. Okay. So this, if, if it was all feds or all a PSI op, all fake, I would not be surprised. We've already seen it. We've had people confess to it. It wasn't even like, Oh, it's a 10 full head conspiracy. You have no proof. They confess. They said they did it. They didn't say it right away. And those who were right there said we're with Glenn, meaning Glenn Youngkin and Republican. So they didn't confess it either, but everybody can see it and knew what was going on. We knew that was fake. We knew it wasn't real. So I think it's the same thing going on here. Again, all these guys probably aren't feds, but a lot of them are, it's like the whole Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping Kerfuffle. Remember that? Remember that whole thing? They're talking about, Oh, there's this, there's this group out there, the Michigan Wolverines. I don't know what they were calling them, right? Whatever they were calling this group. They said they were trying to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, um, hold her for ransom, all types of stuff. Right. Come to find out I have the 20 guys or something that were involved, 18 of them were feds in some kind of way, whether they were directly a federal agent, a federal informant or something. Most of the guys were feds. Most of them. That's how these kinds of white supremacists, white extremist groups work. They're going to be infiltrated very easily. Now here's a question. Some may ask, well, Hey ABL, why would they do something like this? Why would they have these fake groups out there? Um, trying to pose as white extremists or white nationalists, white supremacists. Why are these guys out there doing what they're doing? Well, I think the answer is pretty simple. I think they're trying to scare people. I think they're trying to say, Hey, if you keep voting Republican, these guys are going to take over. These guys are going to be the ones that are running the show. You're not going to be safe from the big bad white man. If these guys get in there, it ain't nothing but just conditioning, programming that has been in many ways fostered by the mainstream media and a lot of the left taking eyes off the prize really, because there's all kinds of crime happening in the country. There's a spike in crime in the country, 100%, but is it coming from the big bad white man or is it coming from somewhere else? There may be some white guys that are involved in a higher crime and I know there is actually, but what kind of white guys we talking about? Are we talking about these guys, these, these federal rallies allegedly out there marching with their flags and things of that nature? Are we talking about them or are we talking about your local crackhead or meth addict out there in Portland, Oregon? We're talking about them or them. Okay. Let's just keep it real. If you're talking about danger to your anyone's safety, who's going to be a bigger threat. These guys out there with a flags or your local crack smoker in Portland or free out of Washington or Los Angeles or San Francisco. The answer is clear. I'm not worried about these guys flying their flags flinging no do do at me, but I know who would do it to me. Right. I know who would do it to me. And then of course you use your suspects, blood scripts. Um, some of the, you know, the Mexican mafia is some of the white mafia, not these guys, not saying they can't be dangerous, but let's look at where their crime is actually happening right now and where it has been coming from for a long period of time. Let's look at that rather than looking at boogeyman that don't truly exist. But I think I'll leave that right there for now. And what say you, how do you feel about this group? Patriot front? Are they real? Are they fake? Is it a matter of both being there? Some guys that truly believe in what they're talking about. They truly believe that they're the superior race artist that in a third mixed with some federales who were just there waiting on them to slip up. Oh, you're going to go do what? At what time? They writing everything down in their mind or they just, you know, they were in a wire and this ain't the old days where you could detect a wire easily, you know, stats a shirt off and this is big box in the chest. No, they could put a small device on you. The size of a grain of rice that you would never see. And they could record everything. They got cameras, audio, video, 4k HD, all that good stuff. So, you know, when I see some of the, the footage recorded by these cameras and it's blurry, you can't really see. I'm like, come on man. Technology exists to be able to get very high quality images, high frame rates, high fidelity, all that good stuff for a very low price. It exists at the whole cow Rittenhouse thing. Wasn't there some federal technology in the sky, a federal drone or something like that, watching the whole situation? Maybe I'm wrong about that, but whoever had the drone in the sky caught some 4k HD quality. So that technology does exist. And it's also on a small form factor, a small scale to where you can't even see it. So the fans are most certainly in these groups. I've seen fair try to infiltrate all kinds of stuff, but I won't go down that road. So I digress. But what say you, do you think that I'm right or wrong? Um, you guys know where I'm at. I think that there is, um, a reason why this is happening. You get the elections coming up, you get these bills coming out. It's all about control. It's all about power. And at the end of the day, it's ultimately about cash, but whatever your thoughts are, please let me know in the comments below. And that's all I got to say for this video. If you like what you heard, please comment, rate, share, hand subscribe, hand subscribe. Peace."
1334,Patriot_Front_March_Set_Up_by_the_Feds_or_Real_Deal_POLITICS_Rubin_Report.mp4," in New York City right now. The City Council is voting soon on a measure that would allow non-citizens to vote in local elections. This has, of course, major implications in the ongoing fight for election integrity. New York City Republicans are already vowing legal challenges if this is in fact passed, and most likely it will. Democrats hope that other cities will follow suit. We'll keep you posted on that. Meanwhile, Los Angeles is on the edge as crime continues to soar there. Take a listen to LAPD Detective Jamie McBride earlier this week. We're wondering how many times does somebody have to be arrested here in LA before they stay in jail? It's sad to say, but it's almost safer to hang out with Alec Baldwin on a movie set than to go shopping in Los Angeles right now. That's how crazy it is. It is so violent. We're telling people, don't visit because we don't think we can keep you safe right now. So it's so bad, police are warning people to stay away from Los Angeles. Joining us now is the host of The Rubin Report, Dave Rubin. His next book, Don't Burn This Country, comes out in April. And Dave, I think you need to speed it up because we're getting pretty close to that point, unfortunately. But great to see you, as always. John, I was trying to be cheeky with that title, and yet here we are. Don't loot this country. I guess I could have said that. By the way, I always like to tell your Chiron guys if they want to put under my name here, depressingly in Los Angeles, that would be just fine hearing a story like that. I know. I'm glad I got to come see you when I did for your birthday a couple months ago. It was like a little bloom of freedom in California for a brief second when Gavin Newsom was up for a recall election. And then, of course, he won. And now it's regressed back to, I think it's, I don't know. I think we've lost California, Dave. But let's move on because I don't know if you saw this or not, but we caught the attention of The Daily Beast this week for a segment we did Monday. Here's the story. Newsmax host wonders if the Patriot Front's DC march was orchestrated by the feds. Now, to be clear, that's not what I was doing. I was just pointing out that the FBI has a bit of a reputation problem. But let's go back to the article here. And another quote of me. Bachman said he wasn't outright declaring the feds were behind the white supremacist march. Again, I'm not doing that. I just said that a lot of people are raising that issue. And The Daily Beast, to their credit, cited a tweet from Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers. She called the group fake. She also cited a tweet from Dinesh D'Souza, who made some pretty good points, I think, about some issues you might pick up with this group here. Dinesh D'Souza has 1.8 million Twitter followers. And the article goes back and they quote me here again, Dave. This is what I said. I'm not saying that the feds are behind this march this weekend. But just for the sake, again, people are raising this issue, Dave. And the issue is that the FBI needs to do some explaining, I think. What Dinesh asked in his tweet, I think, brings some pretty valid points. He says it looks fake. Why are their faces covered? Is it because they are FBI agents posing as right wing extremists? Where are the media interviews? And this is the thing that I think is important. So we can see and hear directly from this group. Why aren't they talking to the press? They went to the National Mall. You think they want the attention? Well, first off, John, you know, you've truly made it when you're quoting yourself on your own show. Pretty good, John Bachman. A good day for you. Look, Daily Beast. Let me just say something about Daily Beast first, because I have no doubt they're watching this right now. It is an absolute trash rag that nobody clicks on except when they run hit pieces or they lie about people or they lie about what people said so that that gets them clicks. They're like, really, in some ways, they're worse than BuzzFeed. They're worse than HuffPo. They're just truly trash. As to the point of all of this, the substance of this, of course it's possible that these were feds. Where is this group's Twitter account? Where is their Facebook feed? Where is their Gab account or other sort of scary right wing white supremacist thing that these people all have? Why do they all sort of look the same? Why couldn't anyone speak to the media? Why were all their faces covered up? I mean, generally, these people that are always told, we're told are right wing main acts. They're not big mask people. Yet all these people had masks on. They all physically sort of look the same. I mean, they all look sort of fit and in their 20s and 30s and 40s. I mean, we're allowed to ask these questions. I mean, after two years of COVID and masks and mandates and vaccines and everything else, like we're all entitled to be a little bit kind of conspiracy theory minded at this point. So you absolutely did nothing wrong. We're allowed to ask. Oh, and by the way, to your broader point, we know that the FBI has been up to some shady stuff over the last couple years with flag operations and planning to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer and a whole bunch other stuff. I mentioned that as well that day. And, you know, after we did our segment, Joe Rogan also talked about that. He raised some of the same issues that you did. And like yourself, he has a pretty big megaphone too in the world of digital media. Here is Joe Rogan. There has never been a thing that I've ever seen where almost immediately I was like, those are feds. Oh, I think I immediately like that's fake. Like my immediate feeling. I looked at them. First of all, these guys are too slim. I'm looking at these guys. They're all in shape. They're all thin. They're they're they're uniformly marching with flags. I mean, there's no way these idiots would be this organized. But if you look at these people walking down the street with their masks on, all dressed in black, all wearing like essentially uniform, all holding the same size American flag. Kind of like the color guard to me, Dave. But, you know, again, I'm not the one I think the Daily Beast or anybody else should be worried about. Why didn't they say anything about anything? Usually, these people have something to say about their conquest to make America white and take over and do all that stuff. They didn't have a sign. They didn't say, hey, could you send us an email or send us a couple of bucks or here's our PayPal address or just absolutely nothing. So I think this is very possible, if not likely. Rogan obviously is asking the right questions, which is exactly what you're asking. And we should all be a bit more skeptical these days. I think we can at least agree on that. And, you know, I enjoy a scholarly pursuit and doing my research. I actually read the ProPublica piece that was cited in the Daily Beast article. And, you know, they mention how this group passes around a lot of propaganda. They are interested in intimidating people. But, you know, one of the guys, I can't remember, the group had been arrested for a gun charge. But none of the things mentioned in the article compared to the destruction we saw across America's cities. And they also quote an anonymous person using the name Samuel. He's from New York, apparently. Here's what he said to ProPublica, quote, I would say the biggest accomplishment of masking up and obscuring our faces. He wrote, we can make them feel as if there are thousands of us when there are only a few hundred and we could be anyone and no one at the same time. Next time they are at CVS and see a white kid with a neat haircut, it could be us. Fear of the unknown is the greatest fear of all. So that's what they want to do to scare us. And we can't let them scare us. That's some fine journalism. Anonymous Samuel said it. Oh, my God. And it fits the narrative that they would always want to get out perfectly. I can't believe it. I'm going to have to really think about this. Yeah, so there we go with that. But anyway, you know, Florida is doing pretty well, actually. But don't listen to Jimmy Kimmel when it comes to COVID. He was making fun of Ron DeSantis last night over the way he, of course, he's handled the whole pandemic. I don't know where Jimmy Kimmel lives in his little bubble in California, but here he is talking about Florida. Florida yesterday reported their first case of Omicron and Omicron reported its first case of Florida. So rest assured, Governor Omicron DeSantis will do everything he can to make sure as many Floridians get infected as possible. You know, there was. Lowest transmission rate in the country, Dave. Yeah, you know, I I don't I personally don't get my pandemic information from people who have been in blackface like Jimmy Kimmel or his ex girlfriend, Sarah Silverman, their big blackface fans. That's just my thing about blackface and pandemic information. But let's even pretend that Jimmy Kimmel believed this thing was as deadly as he would love you to believe. Would he be making jokes about it? Would he be joking about all the dead people in Florida? Of course not. Everyone knows this is basically complete nonsense at this point. This is endless scare tactics. Jimmy Kimmel can live in his 20 million dollar Hollywood Hills mansion and he can wrap his head in saran wrap and put on eighty seven masks. But he doesn't even do that because none of these people live by their rules. They love Gavin Newsom, who declared a state of emergency or extended, I should say, his state of emergency in California about three weeks ago. And then where did he go? He took a vacation in Cabo. It was about 200 grand for the week for his family, believe it or not. John, you ever spend 200 grand on a weekly vacation? I'm guessing not. I know Newsmax pays pretty well. Not yet, Dave. I'm guessing not yet. I will someday, I hope. And where's Gavin Newsom right now? He's in New York City on a book tour and he sat with the shrieking harpies of The View. That's what a state of emergency we're in here. He's hocking a book. It's critical. On The View. Critical times. Yeah. Gavin Newsom. What a gem. Gavin Newsom.

1337,Patriot_Front_Reclaim_America_march_in_DC_was_STAGED.mp4," Today in Washington DC, a group called Patriot Front marched on the Capitol in what they're calling Reclaim America. And just by looking at this, it just doesn't seem genuine whatsoever because you're seeing them all dressed in the same uniform with shields and flags marching to the Capitol, and later on at night, they're FEED THE JUSTICE IN THE HANDS OF A TEMPESTUOUS Having a speech in front of the Capitol building which just looks like a photo op of a really bad TV show on the CW where they're obviously the evil villains. And then later in the evening, they saw a video of them actually being loaded in the back of a U-Haul, which really makes me think that there's no way this is real right now because If they're being loaded in the U-Haul, that means that there's a staging area somewhere else for them to get masked up, to get uniforms, to get shields and everything, and I just- I can't imagine a group of people that love America thinking Yeah, let's do this right now because if you look on Twitter right now, what's trending is Patriot Front, but it's also trending along with the word Feds. So people think that, yeah, this might be like that other rally over outside the Capitol where people are saying, oh, justice for the people on January 6th, and then this group of fine gentlemen showed up where it just doesn't look like this is- They obviously look like they're part of an alphabet organization, and also I covered the video about that rally where it just seemed like it was a distraction for something else because it was like, for every- It was like 9 to 6, for every person that showed up actually for the protest, there was like 9 members of the press and also people that looked like this over there, which didn't seem genuine, and you knew that before where there was other hoaxes where they put together people dressed like somebody that would be scary, but it was only for somebody when they were campaigning against Glenn Youngkin They paid their own people from, I believe it was, I'm forgetting the organization right now, but a Democrat organization paid for these people to come together to make it look like there was, you know, scary bad people from the other side, and it's like, we know there's protests going on in the world right now, like what's happening in New York City against the mandates? Like, this is what a protest looks like because they're not in some uniform, all in lockstep and everything with just matching flags and shields. You see this over here where they even have flags, but it's not like the matching way over in Genoa where they're protesting the mandates over there. You're seeing another protest over in Denmark protesting the mandates. They have drums and also masks just like the Patriot Front group, but it doesn't look like that. They're all just kind of dressed in black. You're looking over in Austria where they're also protesting, and it's like, yes, they have torches and they have, you know, scary torches and the signs, but it just doesn't look like the way they're protesting in the other group, and you're also seeing this group over in Vienna today also protesting, which is all these protests over in, um, drums and flags and everything, but all these protests all across Europe because it's Saturday. And that's when usually the protests are occurring, but it looks nothing like this right now, and what I really think they're trying to do is make you think that there is a group of just Americans that love America, that want patriotism back, that they have a group called Patriot Front, and they want to reclaim America, and I just can't imagine that target demographic they think that they want you to think is joining this group is someone that's going to march like this with the drums and the flags and everything. It just seems like, who would be the group that they're targeting? Would it be like ex-military guys that love America? And I just think of every single person I know from the military, whether they're retired or they're done with it, is, whether they're retired or they're actually active, is absolutely zero of them, in my opinion, would think, okay, I'm in the military, I'm up to like the rank of corporal or sergeant right now, let me restart in a non-paid-for, non-armed, you know, military-type group. And let me be at the very bottom level again and answer to some guy that's probably going to do some serious jail time at some point in time, because I just think of, why would you sign up for this? Why would you look at what happened over to the people on January 6th at protests and they're all serving long jail sentences? Why would you think to yourself, yeah, I'm in the military and I did something for my country, let me rejoin a lesser, like quasi-military organization that's even lower than them and also probably do some long jail- like, it makes zero sense to me that this would be real. But then you look at this almost like bad television show video they recorded in the back of a U-Haul and just listen to this guy right now. We have live updates for today, we are currently in the back of a box truck, there is a caravan of box trucks heading to Washington DC where Patriot Front is going to be marching, demonstrating, and giving some speeches from Thomas Rousseau. Reclaim America! Reclaim America! And then you see them walk down the street with a police escort because you have a cop blocking traffic on the side so they can march more safely.

Okay, so, alright, so the one thing that can sometimes get you with this is sometimes you don't stretch it out far enough so it looks kind of folded, you know. So last time we actually did this one, what, two weeks ago with Walter, we were doing it and the train actually came by so we just hugged that pole, dude, it felt like one of those Indians trying to get on the train. Alright, so yeah, so this is how it should go, right? So we tie it off like this and then we just flip it on over, man. Okay, so you got my zip ties at the ready, right pocket. Alright, you got your zip ties? Yes, sir. Alright. What's up? What's up? Alright. Woo, alright, let's do it, let's do it. I've never seen so much trash in my whole life. Yeah, dude. Tony, we could get some good film too if we just pick that up and, like, a little garbage collector. Alright. Oh, yeah, I think we need to go out a bit further. Let's see if we get any honkers today, I love myself some of those honkers. Alright, this should be good. Stretch out. Yeah, yeah, alright, you go that way, I'm good over here, so you just go further, wait, what, what, huh? No, you should go further that way, right? There we go, see, there we go. Flip it on in. Please be recording. Okay. Flip it over. No, no, it's going to be right, Wes. Trust me, I screwed it up Friday, so I know. Just take this out. Alright, this is the last one.

1361,Rebel_HQ_The_American_Fascists_Have_Arrived....mp4," In the nation's capital, a white nationalist group known as the Patriot Front descended on the National Mall over the weekend. Its members wore masks, some carried plastic shields, and according to their banner, they were marching, as they put it, to reclaim America. White liberty, victory! We brought the helicopter out, there's tons of police. Thomas, why are we marching in D.C.? Our demonstrations are an exhibition of our unified capability to organize, to show our strength, not as brawlers or public nuisances, but as men capable of illustrating a message and seeking an America that more closely resembles the interests of its true people. You can see that- In the hands of a tempestuous mob of would-be warlords and youthful idiots! There's something almost too on the nose about having a bunch of guys dressed up like they're ready to go to war. Dressed up with battle armor and shields because in their minds, the Civil War never ended, right? And what they're chanting is always so telling. Reclaim America. When was America ever taken? And who was it taken from and by whom? Well, they feel like it's been taken from white folks. But since when are brown and black people ahead? Right? So since when are white men still not on top? They're applying logic to their anxiety. My point is to say there is just, there's something so remarkable about having a self-avowed white nationalist, white supremacist, walking, marching on a memorial for somebody who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. I'm Ravonna and welcome back to Rebel HQ. This weekend, white nationalist organization and hate group as designated by the ADL, Patriot Front, marched on the Lincoln Memorial in the nation's capital. Patriot Front split from a larger white nationalist organization called the Vanguard after the deadly Unite the Right rally in order to preserve its image moving forward. Patriot Front espouses racism, antisemitism, and other types of bigoted intolerance under the guise of preserving the ethnic and cultural origins of their European ancestors. They primarily spread their hateful propaganda through the internet, but they also distribute banners, flyers, and posters, particularly around college campuses. Patriot Front's propaganda often includes antisemitic phrases and imagery. It also regularly includes anti-communist and anti-Muslim imagery. This Patriot Front image includes a direct reference to the 14 words, a common white nationalist slogan that is directly tied to the concept of white genocide. DC locals were outraged by the Patriot Front demonstration and drove the Patriot Front members away from the Lincoln Memorial. The locals start herding the Patriot Front members towards the vans that they came in. There's a brief altercation between the locals and the white supremacists until the locals create space for them to leave. The Patriot Front members enter the van and appear to set off a smoke bomb as they're exiting, a tactic often used by the Patriot Front. The van then drives off with the cowardly white supremacists inside and the door still open. Patriot Front and other white nationalist groups like it have no legitimate grievances. There is no such thing as white genocide. America should not be a white supremacist nation. Unfortunately, these white nationalist groups feel comfortable publicly demonstrating their bigoted ideologies because the United States is a country that has white nationalist institutions. There are white nationalists in Congress. And while the Patriot Front members looked absolutely pathetic being chased back into their Penske vans, white nationalists are the largest domestic terrorist threat facing Americans. And Americans need to continue to protest and fight against these white nationalist institutions that embolden these people to act the way that they do."

1375,Shield_commands_1.MP4," This is cycling as a column, right? And the columns being five and five, right? So let's get up and five and five, okay? Let's be wary with the lights. Five and five, right? One, two, three, four, five. Get back there. And then one, two, three. Ready on more? Anyway, we need more room. Y'all get over here. Now, this is what they have the cycling as a column. And I don't like it, but we're going to do it. I don't like it, guys, okay? But what they have suggested is that the column, you want to keep in front of you, the column runs all the way around, just like going back as a section, right? Like back, back, back, but this is on a bigger scale, right? Now, are you taking them around or are you going to take them through? Around is what they can do. And I don't like it. Like if it were me, I would hold ground and I would just double turn back to it. You know what I mean? Well, if we're talking about replacing ranks, you just want he cuts through here, he cuts through there. I mean, that's what I was thinking. Yeah. But you don't, I mean. At the end of the day, we can't have us doing one thing that we like better and then us doing something different. Should we film us doing it at a different work time? We can film a suggestion. Sure. We're going to throw out suggestions all day long. We catapult you over. Yeah. What? Because people are going to be tripping on everyone's feet. Yeah. Do you have something to cover that tattoo? If you have visible tattoos, you may need to be covered up. I'm low, honestly. Yeah. Thank you. Just skim it, man. We got an orange peeler in the back. That's not going to cover it. That makes editing much easier later on. Okay. It also helps keep you in case of, you know, sometimes you can make mistakes. And of course, the command is going to be cycle back. This is the section leader. It's going to be called the section leader, wing leader, over all the crew. Right. So, get your shield. That's a ready. Okay. Oh, that's fine. Okay. When I say cycle back, you guys are going to run back behind that column. Okay. Are all these going to be facing forward? Yeah. I think your back. Or do you want them literally doing something like this? The men behind you are going to be watching your back. Right. But, you know, of course, you're going to react to death. Okay. But everyone's got each other's backs. So, you're going to have to rely on the men behind you to do your back. And the guys behind these men are going to guard your back. Right. So, I'm going to call cycle back. And you all rest behind that column. Okay. All right, section cycle back. No, you've got to go behind. You've got to watch what you're doing there, Ryan. Does anyone want to take lead on that column? I'll try it out, yeah. Okay, you all come back. The other four of you. Okay. We'll do it right now. All right. You guys, the picture of the whole column behind me, okay? I'm at the end. You're kind of stepping a little bit. You know what I'm saying? That's how I would move. That's how you move. I mean, you want to keep your eyes towards the assailants, right? So, you're kind of, you know what I'm saying? Give a demonstration every time you call for movement. So, they know what they're doing. All right, you guys think you all got that? See how I moved there? Yeah, I got it. You got to be. I'll stick to the plan. Yeah. Okay. It won't really be one by one because I want the formation to be in position. All right, so you're team blue, all right? Okay, because team blue, cycle back. There you go. Yeah. Yellow, cycle back. Oh, I like it. That's not so bad. All right, blue, cycle back. There you go. Oh, I like it. That's not bad. You know what? That's not bad. Maybe I'm being overly critical. All right, yellow, cycle back. Now, something that could be handy, y'all might not like it or not, but I don't know if you're ready on that or ready on there. We both. Let's try double. No, fuck it, I'm not going to do it. I think if we could all run back into formation, that could be handy too. Like section, double back, and if everyone just did it in unison. Let's just try and see what it looks like because it could be of use in certain scenarios. Let's actually move back forward and do it. Yeah, that's fine. Let's move back forward and then we'll go back. Because I was inverted. Okay. Now, I'm going to call section because this is a whole section, right? And I'm going to call double back. Double back. All right. All right, section, double back. That's not bad. That's not bad. You want to keep your ranks tight. You want to move together. Okay. Let's try it again. And if you guys ever play any sports, you want to be like a cat. Do you want to incorporate contact with the guy in front of you so you're all paced? I mean, I don't see anything wrong with that. Okay, I'm going to try that. If you guys want to rest, almost like you're resting your shield on it, you can reach forward with the hand on the shoulder. Or you can just arm it. Even if it's just you reach out with the fingertips. Try that. Okay, we'll do fingertips. Let's do section, cycle back. And be light on your feet. That's not bad. That is not bad. Yeah. And as you're backing up, you can periodically look behind. Right, right. Depending on the scenario. And if somebody trips, you can catch them. We're all pretty tight together. A cycle back might be more appropriate, or a double back might be more appropriate. We better go ahead and solidify those turns. Well, what y'all just did was a double back. And, of course, running around the column was a cycle back. Team section, cycle back. Okay, cycle back. Pull, sit down. Okay, so. Let me look at it. I see that's probably making it there. Cycling as a row, cycling as a column. So, cycling as a column would be the two cycle back. Yes. And I just made up a flag. Did that on the fly. So, let's go through. Let's do some cycle backs again as a team, okay? Y'all get back up here. Let's get this way. There you go. All right. Blue and yellow. Just for the sake of demonstration, okay? Team blue, cycle back. There you go. Keep your ranks tight. Yellow, cycle back. Watch. Blue, be aware of your surroundings. That could be a dang building behind you. Blue, cycle back. You're light on your feet. Light on your feet. Yellow, cycle back. All right. That's not bad. Yeah, just skip around a bit. It's not going anywhere. Just get back in formation. Okay, let's do it again. Come on. Get up real close. Yeah, if you guys find that you're skipping or you pass somebody, don't freak out. Just get back in formation. There's going to be a few bumps. You want to be light on your feet. You know what I'm saying? Don't want to. But anyway. Blue, cycle back. There you go. Yellow, cycle back. Blue, cycle back. Wait for the command line. You don't want to get ahead. Then you'll be out on your own. Okay? Yellow, cycle back. There you go. I think we got that pretty much down. Does anyone have any questions on the cycling mission? Anybody at all? So come December, and we haven't seen each other or practiced anybody, you guys are going to remember this, right? And we all have contact with each other on Rocket Chat. We all have one. Any questions for anyone? Y'all get together and talk. Maybe have a beer. We can talk to each other. How it went. And we'll keep getting back. Any questions on any of those missions? So when are we going to be able to actually train this with shields? As soon as we can get some shields. Okay. Because I think that is probably going to be the most important. We're doing the best of what we can. Man, we're doing the best of what we can. Yeah. Or I'll take a bite with some polis. Well, that comes first. I don't see any need to do any more shield cycling. Let's go ahead and get into our fireman carries and any kind of medical response. Okay? If you want to help me lead that, that's fine. And Norman, you've experienced this. We're going to go with basic fireman carries, right? And if someone's limping, right, come on. So if someone's injured and they can't necessarily and one of their legs are incapacitated, you're just going to do this. Take them, Rios. Go ahead and pick them up and get them out of there. That's all you've got to do. That's your basic here. And, guys, notice too what he's doing. Go back and do it again. You're taking where his stomach is laying across of that. You could technically do it with the other side. We don't really want to do that. He may be using this. The guy's getting carried. He may be using his arm to kind of hang on and stabilize a little bit. He's got him wrapped up here with one arm. This hand's free. If you can get away with doing that, so you have one free hand to open doors, use phones, shield, whatever, coms, do it. If you can't, try to get your guy in order. It may get hectic, but have him free on either side. And remember, the thing is you could have the guy also do this. Yeah, this particular casualty is conscious, right? So he can help me out a little bit and, like, put his hand on the small of my back and help throw his weight. And you all be communicating. If he's slipping or he's having a hard time, you have other team members who say, okay, if I have to really quickly put him down and give it to the stronger guy, because in an emergency, let's say, you know, you try to pick up Chris, you can carry him for all of three seconds. You've got to tell your buddy next time, hey, let's readjust. Yeah, we're going to go over the – I don't know the exact term for it, but the two-man carry? Yeah. We'll go over that as well. One gets a leg, one gets arm. So I'll tell you what. Why don't you all pair up and let's carry one man. Did you all carry? Yeah. None of us climbed three and back. Or further. Okay. Yeah, good, good. So what? Just do it right here? You all pair up and you all go through here. I'll switch over. Okay. So if I remember, I want to know how you distribute that out. Good enough for everybody? Yeah. Let's cover that once at the floor. You feel it, Santa? Watch out, I'm going to grab you up further than my shoulder. Roll towards my head. Yeah, there you go. Get comfortable as much as you can. You feel that? Yeah. I can even do something like this if I needed to. You hear? So see how you're slipping down my back? I want you to roll this way. You can put weight on my neck. Feel that? Now let this arm go to my hand. Okay, you feel that? How's that feel? Whatever's comfortable. And you can lean forward in his neck. It's not as hard as it looks. Okay, give it a try. Take your time. Keep it stable. So from here, where you're going, it's going to be going. It's going to be going over this way. So I go over this way? I'm going to go over. Not quite, not quite. I'll get it on you. So if we're here, I'm going to go over there. He just about threw me over. I'm used to my girlfriend. I'm not like. You didn't make me say that. I'm packing into the body. You're helping me here. You're starting to lean over my shoulder as I come here. When I do this, I want a wide base of my legs. Put your hand as small as your back. And again, roll your body towards my neck. I want it right across my shoulders. You can even shift a little bit further than that. You can play around with it. I've actually got a pretty good grip on him. Is it too hectic to where if you feel him like he's falling, it's not like, oh, my gosh, I'm lifting him down. You can only learn if you're too heavy. If you can kind of get him in the brain. Ryan is going to be. You can, and I don't know if we're going to add drag straps to any of our stuff. Probably not. They can be pretty heavy set. It really doesn't screw me up that bad. You can get somebody who's much heavier. You just got to get it. Look at my shoulders. He's laying across my high shoulders. The pressure's not sliding off my back. It's coming down through my spine into my legs. I can maintain a steady walk, and if I'm in shape, I can go ahead and get a run going. It's not too hard. I can't imagine we'll be doing sprints with this guy. Let me carry that. I've got to get it in. See, so I intentionally will roll a little bit. I'll try to shift my weight as best I can. Don't expect this to be perfect. You guys have put hours in. And this is something. When you guys go back home, you're with your local guys. We'll practice on Ryan real quick just to get the movements down. You've got to be the lightest weight here. Who's the heavy? How heavy are you? 196. There we go. Shawn, what are you about? 250. Shawn's heavy. Maybe Jackson. I don't see why. Keep in mind, though, guys, if you're the one being carried, even if you're hurting, you probably will be hurt, you want to actively be trying to distribute your weight over your partner's shoulders and help them. And you're communicating the whole time. It's not the sort of nobody talk, and then fall, like none of that. You want to be kind of laying forward. Let me see if I can get you, Shawn. There you go. There's your big boy. I know I see it. Stop for one second. You bump up. I can get here. This is comfortable. This is not hard. There you go. Let's go to the Gary Meere. I think we got that. Feel the weight? Yeah. That's how I got this. Push it in a little bit. Left arm is tighter. There you go. There you go. And of course. It's all right. It's all right."

1393,speaking1.mp4, The whole cannot do without either. Our opposition ideologies don't believe in either. They don't believe in an individual. They don't believe in a whole. They just believe in chaos and in the energies. They believe in abusing the self to worthlessness. And they believe in subjugating the whole into a bastardized version of a state.
1394,speaking10.mp4," Today we have a state that wants to make its own natural law, you know, in straight defiance of natural law."
1395,speaking11.mp4, that are patriot-front activists.
1396,speaking12.mp4," Natural collectives of identity are all that has ever truly motivated men to do great things and likely all that ever will. Even the preceding centuries of examples where men died en masse for regimes, monarchs, or parties is ultimately a single degree of separation from the true natural collective they were motivated by, community and nation."
1397,speaking13.mp4," facing the planet. The critiques of nationalism deny the undeniable in the existence of an innate human nature. To dissolve the natural collectives of identity is only possible if you replace them with something much worse that will result in the enslavement, subjugation, and breaking of the spirits of man.

1422,Stupidity_Got_The_Better_Of_These_White_Supremacists.mp4," This weekend, the white nationalist group Patriot Front was seen marching at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. They were heard making calls to quote, reclaim America, end quote. We are currently in the back of a box truck. There is a caravan of box trucks heading to Washington, D.C. where Patriot Front is going to be marching, demonstrating, and giving some speeches from Thomas Rousseau. Reclaim America! Formerly known as Vanguard America, the group rebranded following the killing of Heather Heyer at the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally. The Southern Poverty Law Center calls the Patriot Front an image-obsessed organization that rehabilitated the explicitly fascist agenda of Vanguard America with garish patriotism. Patriot Front focuses on theatrical rhetoric and activism that can be easily distributed as propaganda for its chapters across the country. White lives matter! White lives matter! White lives matter! Thomas, why are we marching in D.C.? Our demonstrations are an exhibition of our unified capability to organize, to show our strength not as brawlers or public nuisances, but as men capable of illustrating a message and seeking an America that more closely resembles the interests of its true people. That was before this happened. Like bumbling idiots, they filed into their U-Haul and realized they couldn't fit. Our demonstrations are an exhibition of our unified capability to organize, to show our strength not as brawlers or public nuisances, but as men capable of illustrating a message and seeking an America that more closely resembles the interests of its true people. We are currently in the back of a box truck. There is a caravan of box trucks. Naturally, the internet took this opportunity to show them just how stupid they looked. Reclaim America! Has anyone seen the U-Haul trucks? I think I left my white mask in there. I just bought my khakis on Black Friday at Walmart. It was a BOGO! Does anyone know when the rental trucks are coming back to pick us up? They wouldn't leave us behind, right? Right? Hey, mom, can you come pick me up? My friend's left me again. Yeah, I have your cookware. But don't let their stupidity blind you from their malicious intent. From the Patriot Front Manifesto, quote, an African, for example, may have lived, worked, and even been classed as a citizen in America for centuries, yet he is not American. He is, as he likely prefers to be labeled, an African in America. The same rule applies to others who are not of the founding stock of our people, as well as to those who do not share the common unconscious that permeates throughout our greater civilization and the European diaspora. Replace us! U-Haul! Replace us! U-Haul! Replace us! Disgusting. Let's just hope their ability to execute is as bad as their ability to organize. Reclaim America! Has anyone seen the U-Haul trucks? I think I left my white mask in there. Thanks for watching."

1424,The_Young_Turks-White_Supremacists_Stage_Their_Revealing_Fantasy.mp4," I'm always a little bit nervous in 2021 when I hear about gatherings at the Capitol and based on the B roll that is next to me, you probably should be too. Because here is a look at some of what happened when a group of white supremacists went to downtown Washington DC during this weekend. Here's a bit of the video of the Reclaim America protesters. So anyway, you can tell from the crowd that people are absolutely shocked that they're thinking of it as a July the cacky is what they're all about Francesca. So they gather there, they've got their flags, they've got their faux Captain America shields. They've got a guy doing the riff on a drum that he learned in third grade, and oddly enough, they wore masks. So they can find opportunities where it's not too onerous to have to cover up their face a little bit. But anyway, it's a patriot front. Their leader Thomas Rousseau spoke saying our demonstrations are an exhibition of our unified capability to organize, to show our strength. Not as brawlers or public nuisances, but as men capable of illustrating a message and seeking an America that more closely resembles the interests of its true people. And I love the last bit of that because if it wasn't clear what direction this is going in when you talk about the, yeah, the chat marks it. The true people are what's sometimes called classic Americans on Fox News. So they're all of native descent, right? They're all indigenous under those white masks. I have to assume they're wearing masks, I don't know. The original. It's Native Americans wearing khakis. Yes. And marching around. I have to assume that's what it is. Absolutely. No, I'm sorry. We just talked about video games and I held my tongue, I really did. But when I see- No. Grown ass men in khakis with little shields and little masks and all the same uniform. And I'm just like either this is a Best Buy geek squad gone wrong, or we just watched too many video game, we just replayed too many. Maybe we play too many video game. Look at these dudes. What does this have to do with video game? It's all fantasy. It's all weird fantasy to me. They should be at home playing video games right now rather than what they're doing. Yes, but it's just casual. It's just khaki cosplay. I don't know. I don't where does this? It's just very like- No, the khaki cosplay comes from spending too much time on sites like 4chan and watching Fox News and Ben Shapiro. It's getting crowded and all that. Can we roll back a little bit because you feel like they look like stormtroopers at the end there. Look at the knee pads. Hang on. These guys don't have it. Here comes some stormtrooper. Yes. They're about to be. I don't. Is that like, well, I want to look tough. I want to wear armor. What do I got? Well, I played a little bit of roller hockey when I was growing up. So I got some pads. I don't know. What are they doing on their knees? Why are they wearing knee pads? Why do they have to be on their knees so much with other men who represent the original- Stop it. Americans and but a lot of knee work. Stop it. You're the worst. You're worse than the Patriot front. I just want to be clear about that. Leading garbage person for today, Francesco Fiorentini. But anyway, I want to show we had a little bit more footage. Actually, can we skip ahead to the third video? Because at some point, I believe this is the video I'm thinking of. There was a clip where I can talk over there. There's a little bit of clash with counter protesters and then they run away and in a very clown car fashion. I think they load into a U-Haul. Do we have that last video? I don't know why they came in U-Hauls. There's cars and there's public transportation. But this is not the video that I saw, but they all just flee into any U-Hauls. And you can see them there. And again, you so nailed it with the khaki cosplay. It's just so, you know everything about these people and what they represent. I should tell you a little bit about their history, though. So this group used to be called, where is it? It's the Vanguard America, was it called? Yeah, Vanguard America changed their name after a man affiliated with the group murdered a woman at the notorious Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. So yeah, I wanted to note that I saw in response to one of the videos being spread on Twitter. Someone was talking about how we're now just regularly having fascists marching in the Capitol. And this Trump loving woman responded saying, you guys call everything fascism. Why do you do that? But it's not a leap in this case. That's what these people are. So anyway, it's more concerning that we call them fascists than that they launch for the interests of true Americans. By the way, as a guy that has all of the privilege that they do, I am a straight white cis male. Can I just say, what do they think that people like us are lacking right now that we need to reclaim? It's all still set up for people like us. But they just have been convinced that no matter how much they have, no matter how much they're given, they're the ones that are truly being ignored, truly being left behind. So when they say that they need to unite for true Americans, what do they mean by that? What would they like to see happen? Marvel is too woke, number one. And Ghostbusters, also. Women in Ghostbusters. My God, wait, Francesca. I'm just reading breaking news in the Hollywood Reporter. Disney is making a sequel to Shang-Chi. That's it. Wow. When is Disney going to give us movies for true Marvel fans? You're right. The wokeness has finally gone too far. Wait, are you excited? Did you just get up in excitement or anger? I am actually excited. I really like this. I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. I am actually excited. I really like the first one. I saw it twice. But anyway. But it does bother some people. Anyway, yeah, I can't wait to see what's happening. No, I mean, and this is when you don't understand democratic socialism, basic critiques of capitalism, the importance of unions, internationalism. You don't study history. You're just so bored with your life and you think, or look, are you Scottish, Irish? Are you Portuguese? Are you any kind of interesting? Your family is probably German maybe, I don't know. Celebrate, get a Stein out and celebrate German heritage except not the weird part, the spacious part. You know what I'm saying? You could be proud to be where you're from, but don't make it about your whiteness because that's a construct, bro. And it's also very bad and weird. I just see a lot of boredom. So maybe I'm eating my words. Maybe we need better video games, more interesting video games. Maybe that's the problem. Let's have that. That sounds fine by me. But yeah, no, you're right. It is scary that we, here's the thing. When it's Antifa, or a militant part of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is a very small, small, small portion of it. I mean, Fox News, Newsmax, everyone just gets obsessed with that small militant portion of it. But on the other hand, when this happens, nobody really covers it. because it's seemingly below, again, the NBCs, the CNNs. We're not going to cover that. It's just everyday fascism. We have to cover these things because we've seen the ways, yeah, this was the group that was responsible or partially responsible for the death of Heather Heyer at the Unite the Right rally. You think it might be important to see what they're up to now under their new names. But that's somehow so beneath a lot of mainstream media outlets, they don't even cover it. You think it might be important? They didn't, they just stormed the Capitol. Remember that? Remember the Oath Keepers? And the 58th percentile? I don't know what they're called. You remember the one 16th percentile, which is the size of their, it's the, I don't know if it's the whiteness or- I don't know, look, I think again, covering it, you would then have to talk about who they support, who supports them. It acknowledges too much to really focus on it. I just want to mention one last thing, I'm trying to find it. So here's the issue with some people, when you know that they tweeted something, so the next day you load up their Twitter and it takes you five minutes of scrolling just to get through one day of their tweeting. What is wrong with some people, seriously? Some people's entire life is just being on Twitter. Anyway, so Dinesh D'Souza, where is this damn tweet? I really should have had it ready. Anyway, I'll summarize. So he says that those marchers are not the group that they openly say that they are, that it's a false flag, that they are in fact, take a closer look. Does this look real to you? Or does this look like a group of federal agents pretending to be right wing extremists? So no, but this is what they do now. Everything is Alex Jones, that's why we did the impression last week, it's all a false flag. It's literally their group, their leader gave a speech. No, it's feds. It's the FBI, why? Because maybe it makes us look bad? But simultaneously it's good because look at us and we're so organized. Everything is a false flag, everything is Antifa simultaneously. There are no actual conservatives in America. It's just Antifa pretending to be conservative, did you know that? Anyway. I mean, what the funniest part about it is that you see like, you're just jealous of the people who are in the middle of it. Are you jealous of Antifa? Clearly you're ripping off some of their style, giving it your khakis flair. And you're pro-fascist, not anti-fascist. Or as one brave militia member said, anti-anti-Antifa, anti-Antifa, which is the best. It's the best. It's the best. It's the best. It's the best."

1431,"VERIFY_No,_video_doesn_t_show_Patriot_Front_being_chased_out_of_D.C..mp4"," On Saturday, members of the Patriot Front marched through DC, demonstrators carrying a banner reading Reclaim America. The Southern Poverty Law Center calls the group a quote, white nationalist hate group. The Anti-Defamation League calls them a quote, white supremacist group. You might have seen videos of the crowd on social media, specifically this one which popped up December 4th and now has 1.2 million views, writing quote, white supremacists being chased out of DC by teens with cell phones. But not everything you see online is what it seems. So let's verify, was this video really taken during that recent visit by the Patriot Front? Our Verify researchers traced that video back to July. It was July 4th to be exact, the day that the same group marched through Philadelphia. Here's another angle of the same altercation tweeted out in July. At the time, the official Penske truck Twitter account said that they did not condone the group and said that they would take action against the renters of that truck. Fast forward to this week, Penske put out another statement the night of December 4th, saying that the footage was from Philadelphia in July and that no Penske trucks were involved in the DC march. So we could verify that no, that viral video was not taken in DC on December 4th. If you see something online that seems questionable, you could send it to the team at verify at WUSA9.com. With your Verify, I'm Evan Kosloff."

1437,Video_shows_masked_White_nationalist_group_marching_at_Lincoln_Memorial.mp4," A chilling sight in the nation's capital, a white nationalist group known as the Patriot Front descended on the National Mall over the weekend. Its members wore masks, some carried plastic shields, and according to their banner, they were marching, as they put it, to reclaim America. Joining me now, early start anchor and CNN correspondent Laura Jarrett, back with the CNN senior political analyst John Avalon. Look, we can agree that one is too many, right? To see anyone marching a white supremacist to the Lincoln Memorial is a sight that none of us ever wants to see. There's something almost too on the nose about having a bunch of guys dressed up like they're ready to go to war, dressed up with battle armor and shields, because in their minds, the Civil War never ended, right? And what they're chanting is always so telling, reclaim America. When was America ever taken? And who was it taken from and by whom? Well, they feel like it's been taken from white folks. But since when are brown and black people ahead, right? Since when are white men still not on top? My point is to say, there's something so remarkable about having self-avowed white nationalists, white supremacists, marching on a memorial for somebody who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It just sort of exemplifies the country's ongoing struggle with racism. Yeah. And look, the fact that we're seeing an acceleration in the wake of Charlottesville, that these are young folks and they're masking and they're carrying shields and battle armor, which of course is a sign of their own weakness. These are weak, anxious people trying to find definition and strength in this kind of militaristic white nationalist nonsense. The reason it's more than just a bunch of clowns trying to march on the Lincoln Memorial is the ADL found that this particular group, the Patriot Front, was responsible for 80% of the white supremacist propaganda found on campus and elsewhere in 2020. And it's a young person's movement. This isn't just a bunch of old cranks waving their fist at the sky about how the country is changing. The leader is 23 years old. I will tell you, they were wearing masks. One of the things I felt that was most chilling about Charlottesville was people walking around unmasking. Here I am. I have no shame over this. We are free to express ourselves because that's where we think we are in this country right now. They didn't want their identities known. Yeah. Who also wore masks and face coverings. I mean, I don't want to think we're going to take too much comfort from that. I'm not. But I'm saying there's a difference here. And I don't know whether it's not that they think that the attitude in the country is different towards the message that they're delivering or not. It is notable. But the question is really what has changed since Charlottesville, right? I mean, that's 2017. The FBI director, to your point, the idea that we dismiss this as sort of fringe actors, the FBI director, right? Chris Wray has told us that the number one threat to this country, domestic terrorism wise, is white supremacy. He has said that this is on par with ISIS. And the question is, since Charlottesville, what have we done? What has the government done to address this? There has been legal accountability and culpability, as we saw, I mean, in a verdict, you know, in Charlottesville to the tune of $26 million. And maybe why they were masked, by the way. It may very well be. And none of that changes the fact that these folks are cowards. Everyone who runs to find security in a blood and soil movement is because they are weak and they're trying to pretend they're strong. But we also shouldn't underestimate the historical resonance of this, which is why Laura is saying it. And the fact that this is a current issue in our country that we need to confront when they come masked and carrying battle shields to the Lincoln Memorial. You know, pay attention, folks, because this is a problem that we need to confront. This virus of hate and white supremacy and white nationalism in our country is not done yet. The only good thing is this one didn't turn violent, but the next one could. And that's always the concern. Laura Chair, John Avalon, thank you very much."

1537,Viral_Patriot_Front_March_REACTION.mp4," There was a very scary insurrectionist, nation-threatening march in Washington, D.C. over the weekend. You might have seen it trending on Twitter. This was the march of the Patriot Front, so-called, a group allegedly of fascists and white supremacists. And they marched through D.C. and the media, oh, they had a field day and they said, this is the white supremacist takeover of America, and you can't really see who any of these people are. And they're wearing masks and they're marching, and they've got flags. Some of the flags are upside down to signal distress. My first reaction was that this was Fed Picnic Part 2. You know, do you remember there was the justice for January 6th rally and the only people who showed up were feds and media? And like one right-wing dude who didn't get the memo that it was all fake. And so, that was my first reaction was, look, I'm on the American right. I spend a lot of time in the American right. I've been in it for a long time. I'm familiar with lots of fringe groups, okay, even the ones that are way out there. I'm at least familiar with them. I've never heard of this group. Have you, the Patriot Front of the white supremacist national whatever? No. So was it a Fed thing or what, or is it real? I don't know. Maybe it's real. Even assuming for a second that this is a real group and there aren't any feds and it's not fake and not just a media contrivance. Ask yourself this, what poses a bigger risk to you? A bunch of clowns marching through the streets, not harming anybody, making a big show and giving the media a circus, but not burning down any stores or killing people or assaulting people and just kind of marching around and going home, probably back to Quantico or Langley or something, but whatever. Does that pose the bigger threat to you or does, say, BLM and Antifa with the support of the entire media and elected Democrats for six months burning down the country, does that pose the bigger threat? What's the real threat here? The real threat is according to the establishment, BLM, which killed dozens of people and torched cities around the country and stole a lot of Gucci handbags, BLM was mostly peaceful. And according to the media, those guys whose identities we don't know conveniently, those guys marching peacefully for a few hours, they are an insurrectionist threat to destroy the country. Obviously, the narrative seems a little bit backward. Hold up. I'm glad you liked that clip. Before you do anything, nope, before you even think, ring that bell. Ring it, please. Thank you.

1622,WA_DSCF3448.MOV, there's something America's first patriot front dot us. I think you really need four on those and like five
1623,White_Nationalists_Go_Mainstream_MSNBC_Zerlina..mp4," We begin tonight with really what's a chilling image. On Saturday, hundreds of white nationalists marched at the Lincoln Memorial. You see them there on the screen. They were wearing white masks, carrying plastic shields, and chanting, reclaim America. The group that organized the march is called Patriot Front. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, they are one of the country's leading white supremacist groups. And that imagery from the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday is reminiscent of another rally we saw not too long ago, the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, back in 2017. The fatal demonstration was organized in part by a group called Vanguard America. Patriot Front was formed by members of Vanguard America. They splintered off after a man affiliated with Vanguard America, John Adams, murdered Heather Heyer in Charlottesville. The name might have changed, but the message remains very much the same. And the leader of Patriot Front isn't some old, wrinkled, Jim Crow era racist that you might picture in black and white movies. It's this guy, Thomas Rousseau. He's only 23 years old. He led the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville as a teenager. And he's been on the FBI's watch list since he was in high school. Rousseau represents a new generation of Americans that still carry the same old racist ideals of their ancestors. They seek to reclaim an America in which white people are the dominant majority. The problem with this is the America that these groups are trying to reclaim just doesn't exist, at least anymore. Whether they like it or not, in about two decades, America is expected to become a minority white country. Census data from 2020 shows that over the last decade, the white population declined in all 50 states. These groups can't fight those demographic shifts. They're coming. But that's not stopping their members from organizing and marching to spread their message of hate. Joining me now is MSNBC political analyst Juanita Tolliver, and the executive director of the Terror Asymmetrics Project. Juanita, I want to play you sound from Hillary Clinton at a campaign rally way back in 2016. There's probably not a day that goes by that I don't think of this. Take a listen. From the start, Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. He is taking his own life. He is taking his own life. He is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party. His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous. Now, Juanita, context for that particular moment in the campaign was the hiring of Steve Bannon. And so Hillary Clinton was trying to speak to the threat it posed that Donald Trump was affiliating himself and essentially putting in charge somebody so close to white nationalists. Do you think Donald Trump's the reason why white nationalists and other extremist groups again feel super comfortable going to the Lincoln Memorial and occupying spaces in public? Do you think it's as simple as that? I think it is that simple, Zerlina. And I do want to express that there is nothing new about white supremacy and white nationalism in this country. But what Trump did is he gave those white supremacists and white nationalists something they'd never had before, the public support of a president. That is what made them so comfortable. That is what has emboldened them. And let's be real, he beat the drum of that every day on the campaign trail as a candidate and every day while in office as president. And what's frustrating about this is that it didn't stop with Trump. He ushered in a whole new wave of other individuals to continue to do his bidding as members of Congress. Look at Gosar, Boebert, Hawthorne, Marjorie Taylor Greene. The list can go on and on because every single time that Trump or one of those individuals signals, these people are ready to mobilize. They're ready to continue to recruit. They're ready to continue to turn out. And we live in a post-January 6th reality where those same individuals attended a rally for Trump outside of the White House and walked to the Capitol building where they proceeded to attack police officers and threaten the lives of every person in that building. There is no other way to state it, Darlena, except for recognizing the clear through line that Trump and his posture and his position empowered these groups to be their full white supremacist selves every single day. So one of the things, I don't even know if I've ever told you this, Malcolm, but the day before Charlottesville, I watched you on a panel in NABJ in New Orleans, and you said there is a growing threat of white supremacist terrorism in the country. They're gonna commit acts of violence. And you mentioned the Proud Boys, and I won't forget it and link those two things because it was the day right before. I mean, do you think that Donald Trump emboldened this? I mean, we're not just post-insurrection, we're also post-Charlottesville. So thinking back to the fact that you've been on this since before Heather Heyer was murdered, what do you think about the connection between what Donald Trump is saying, what those folks in Congress are saying, and how that emboldens this kind of behavior? You know, next year I have a new book coming out, which is going to detail all of this. But let's step back to Charlottesville for a moment. What you saw at Charlottesville was what they said they were being, which was to unite the right. You saw small disparate groups of white supremacists come out of nowhere, organize together, bring themselves to do essentially what was a coming out ball of white supremacists, revisionist, you know, Southern secessionist, these throwbacks, militia groups that came down there, like the Virginia militias that actually came to protect them, and every type of nasty neo-Nazi that there is, and you saw them create a wing of the conservative movement in a way that didn't exist before. I mean, even in the heydays of the 1980s of militias and small groups, they would never come out of the woodwork the way that they came at Charlottesville. But after Charlottesville, it was the opprobrium. It was the shame of the death of Heather Heyer, Donald Trump being insulted by just about everyone for calling them very fine people on both sides, that these groups went underground for a few years. They only emerged again in the summer of 2020 with the George Floyd protests. However, when they came back, they were not coming back as the alt-right. They were coming back as what they themselves saw was the armed wing of the Trump campaign. So to go to your question, was Donald Trump responsible for this? Yes, not only was he responsible for it, he is their sponsor of all of this. And when the George Floyd protests started, these people supporting Trump and his actions using law enforcement in places like Portland and Kenosha and all these other places came out as the unofficial armed paramilitary of the Trump campaign. And I said this before the election. I said, if Trump wins, these people will self-appoint as the brown shirts. If Trump loses, they will become an underground paramilitary insurgency working in unison with the political arm of the Republican Party to create destabilization and insurrection. And I actually said that on Bill Maher's show on November 6th of last year. Five, four, three, two, one, 62 days later, we have the insurrection. Since then, groups like Patriot Front, once again, were shamed till about March, and they now all are coming up to the surface as the insurgents that I predicted. And this is only going to get much worse. They are gaining steam. So as Malcolm lays all of that out, Juanita, what do you think the solution on the political front to this is? Because obviously law enforcement is going to look into any criminal actions taken by these folks. And obviously, related to the insurrection, those prosecutions are very much still ongoing. But in terms of political leadership, I feel like they've been emboldened, to Malcolm's point, by Donald Trump. They've been given permission by elected Republicans who are not condemning this behavior. I mean, what would it look like if Republicans and Democrats agreed that this is not okay? Political violence is not okay. White nationalists marching to the streets is not okay. What would it look like for them to condemn this appropriately? Well, I want to first answer the question, is it even possible to get Republicans to say that it's wrong for white supremacists to march through the streets like this? Because based on what we've seen from Republicans and congressional leadership, as well as national leadership within the Republican Party, they have not done that. They have shown that they will not do that. And so they've kind of relinquished their ability to even call it out at any point in the future. I do think that through their silence, they have fully emboldened further people who I named before, the Boebert, the Taylor Greens, the Gosars, who we know have expressed violent language and rhetoric all in the name of scoring political points. Because keep in mind, Republicans knew what they were signing up for when McCarthy won in Pitt's Trump's ring just days after January 6th, and said, I want to align myself with you to try to win back the House in 2022. That is the deal that the Republicans made essentially with the devil here. And there's no way for them to backtrack on that. Now, in terms of accountability from Democrats, you absolutely should see the same force that you've seen from them in holding members of Congress accountable for their violent rhetoric and behavior. And Democrats absolutely need to keep their foot on people's necks. And that goes all the way to the White House. So while we can't expect Republicans to step up, I fully expect Biden to speak out on this. I fully expect him to condemn it and talk about how he's funding the FBI to investigate and stop and neutralize these domestic terrorist groups, which FBI Director Christopher Wray testified just in September that their caseload has more than doubled. It's exploded over there because these groups are mobilizing, they're recruiting at ridiculous rates right now. And it's a lot that it's gonna take to get it under control. It is really scary. It is the antithesis to the multiracial democracy that we are all participating in and we would like to see thrive. And so I hope that you are right, that law enforcement is on it and we'll see how the political stuff plays out in the next election cycle. Juanita Tolliver and Malcolm Nance, who left earlier, but he was there. So thank you so much, both of you, for starting us off tonight."

1625,White_Nationalist_Group_Marches_Through_DC_Saying_Reclaim_America.mp4," More than 100 members of a white nationalist group called the Patriot Front held a disturbing rally in DC on Saturday in an effort to, they say, reclaim America. The group of men marched from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol just blocks from the White House. They obscured their faces with sunglasses and white masks and wore matching uniforms. Many held American flags, while others held banners that read Reclaim America. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Patriot Front broke off from the other white nationalist group called Vanguard America after a member of that group used his car to kill Heather Heyer at the deadly Unite the Right rally protest in Charlottesville in 2017. According to the Anti-Defamation League, members of Patriot Front believed their ancestors conquered America and handed it down to them. The leaders of the group said they marched on Saturday to show their strength and ability to organize. But at the end of the rally, they reportedly struggled to reclaim their ride back home. The Daily Beast wrote this. Members of the group had waited in a one-way roundabout to depart in one of the U-Haul trucks that they had used to transport themselves to the rally. But the large, rented moving van could not fit them all, so many of them were forced to wait in 45-degree darkness as the bulky orange vehicle made multiple trips over the course of nearly three hours. Joining me now to discuss is Professor of American Social Thought and Chair of the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, Anthea Butler, and founder of One People's Project, Darrell Lamont Jenkins. So, Anthea, I want to start with you. I mean, one thing that's interesting about this group is that it's, first of all, how young they are. You can just tell that just from the pictures, even though you can see their faces. This is a bunch of young people. They do a lot of their organizing activism on college campus. Actually, when the ADL looked at all the propaganda on college campuses, like the posters and stickers and all that stuff, they were the number two group doing that. I think a lot of times we think of white nationalists as old men from the rural parts of somewhere in the sticks and coming and raising against the cities. But things are not that. What does this portend that these are young people focused on college campus and that kind of recruitment? I think it portends something very serious. And I think, Charles, one of the things that I believe the press has missed, although people have started paying attention to Charlie Kirk and others who have been organizing on campuses with organizations that attack professors and do all this. What's interesting about Patriot Front is that they see themselves as this front line group that can march and go to the Lincoln Memorial, like, be at us lockstep, because I don't think they look very organized to me. But to put up sense of intimidation, and I think that's what the most important thing about this is, is that the covering the face, covering your eyes with the sunglasses, wearing the flags. This is indicative of all the kinds of KKK marches we saw that went in the 20s in Washington, D.C. and other places, the kinds of Lufthansa marches through Germany, all of this kind of stuff and things where you see KKK marching as well in the South in the 50s and 60s. So what I would say about this is this. You know, while everybody is sort of saying college campuses are hotbeds of liberalism and all of this other stuff, it's also hotbeds for recruitment for conservative groups. And that is what they have been doing in a lot of different ways for the last 10 to 15 years underneath the radar screen. And now what we can see are things like Patriot Front that are coming out into the open and asserting their white supremacist ideals and beliefs. So do you think that some of what's happening on college campuses is a backlash against white by white men against the idea that they were being constantly told to check their privilege, right? That they had a set of privileges that were above and beyond everybody else's and of all the people who needed to kind of listen and absorb the pain of others. It was them. And because I, you know, I did a lot of speaking at college campuses. I kept picking that up. Like there was just an energy around these men that was, you know, I didn't do this and I am getting tired of being blamed for this. Do you believe that there are that some of this is is an outgrowth of that? Yes, I do. Oh, I'm sorry. No, no, no. Go ahead. Go ahead. I would say that is definitely that. I mean, I met Matthew Heimbach, who was a well-known neo-Nazi activist at Towson University, where he was in fact organizing. So we do see that element regularly on college campuses. We saw it in Michigan when a chapter of the Young Americans for Freedom became listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white supremacist organization. You know, I mean, Patriot Front, however, I mean, yes, they are young. And to be perfectly honest with you, this is basically the totality of Patriot Front. They put their stickers on lampposts and things. They have these little flash mob rallies every now and again. The last one was in Philadelphia, and it didn't work out too well for them because people confronted them and they weren't even allowed to get into their box trucks because that's illegal to ride in the back. But we have to look at how the influence of right wing organizations like the Leadership Institute and Turning Point USA try to basically recruit people on college campuses. People on college campus to do these kinds of things, not necessarily join white supremacist groups, but engaging these kinds of campaigns against that which the right feels are threats to them. And do you believe that the geography of hate groups is shifting? I was looking at the map that is produced by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and it's very interesting. I think our associations are dated around white supremacy, so people still associate the Klan with the South, and they still think the Klan is a big, scary thing. But there are just so few Klan chapters now, so few Klan members. But where the energy is, the people who get the headlines, those groups are not as prominent in the South. They're prominent outside of the South. And when you look at the leadership of those groups, a lot of those people never lived in the South. Yeah, exactly. I mean, you can think about places like Oregon as a hotbed of white supremacists, and people don't think about it like that. But I think to the point that was made about Turning Point and campus reform, what you have to understand is there's so much money behind this. This is a lot of money that is fueling these organizations. They're not grassroots organizations. They're not asking people for $5 and $10. They're getting millions of dollars to be able to get in front of all of this and fund people and fund the kinds of programs that appear on college campuses. So that resentment that you see, that you might have felt when you were doing college campus tours before the lockdown, was a way in which they have stoked this through social media, through organizing, through all other kinds of things. And so I think what we see is that it's not just a backlash to, I don't want to take a class about ethnicity. It's a class about, I feel like I'm being replaced, and I don't want to have anybody replace us. So this is where this Take Back America kind of language comes from. And when you put that together with the kinds of things that has happened when we were in the Trump era, and afterwards with trying to steal the election on 1-6, what you have is a very potent stew as we come up to the anniversary of 1-6, where there are going to be people who are going to be asserting themselves and still saying that the election has been stolen, and at the same time wanting to organize and get ready for 2022. So, you know, I always think back when I see these sorts of things about colleges and whatever, to the young man who was at Columbia, and he was talking about, you know, white men invented the modern world, and, you know, I love white men and whatever. And I'm not suggesting he's part of any sort of hate group or white supremacist group, but that sentiment growing on college campuses, which is that there, you know, there's a version of history in which white men dominate and control that has an intellectual audience and cheer squad. And, you know, I wonder whether you think how that relates to politics. Is politics, our current politics feeding that, or is that thing kind of helping to fan the flames of our current politics? Well, I find it interesting that when this little rally happened, the first thing that you saw the right do on social media was not to denounce the group and say that they do not represent their values, but to go into damage control and do their usual stunts, saying they never heard of the group. They are possibly feds or Antifa or the media created them. When that happens, I look at it as them telling on themselves because they realize that it is their work. It is their things that they have been doing over the past several decades that led to this. I mentioned Matthew Heimbach a couple of minutes ago. He was representing a group called Youthful Western Civilization. Now, that group was organized at CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference. And a lot of what that group did is what we're fighting now is what you see when you see those knuckleheads marching in the street last weekend. So, yeah, they do have a lot of culpability in all of this. We have to recognize that. Anthea Butler and Darrell Lamont Jenkins, thank you very much, guys, as always. I really appreciate it."
1626,White_Supremacists_Stage_Their_Revealing_Fantasy.mp4," I'm always a little bit nervous in 2021 when I hear about gatherings at the Capitol and based on the B roll that is next to me, you probably should be too. Because here is a look at some of what happened when a group of white supremacists went to downtown Washington DC during this weekend. Here's a bit of the video of the Reclaim America protesters. We're all one, right? Things haven't been quite exactly like the Championship match. And where can I get a police canine before I rack it up? Bye guys. All right, guys, let's move on. Today we're wrestling with Kandi Brown. Let's get to work. So anyway, you can tell from the khakis what they're all about Francesca. So they gather there, they've got their flags, they've got their foe, Captain America shields. They've got a guy doing the riff on a drum that he learned in third grade. And oddly enough, they wore masks. So they can find opportunities where it's not too onerous to have to cover up their face a little bit. But anyway, it's a patriot front. Their leader Thomas Rousseau spoke saying our demonstrations are an exhibition of our unified capability to organize, to show our strength. Not as brawlers or public nuisances, but as men capable of illustrating a message and seeking an America that more closely resembles the interests of its true people. And I love the last bit of that because if it wasn't clear what direction this is going in, when you talk about the, yeah, Brooks marks in the chat marks it, the true people, or what's sometimes called classic Americans on Fox News. Traditional Americans. They're all of native descent, right? They're all indigenous under those white masks. I don't know. The original. It's Native Americans wearing khakis. Yes. And marching around. I have to assume that's what it is. Absolutely. No, I'm sorry. We just talked about video games and I held my tongue. I really did. But when I see- No. Grown ass men in khakis with little shields and little masks and all the same uniform and I'm just like either this is a Best Buy geek squad gone wrong. Or we just watch too many video game. We just replayed too many. Maybe we play too many video game. Look at these dudes. What does this have to do with video game? It's just it's all fantasy. It's all weird fantasy to me. They should be at home playing video games right now rather than what they're doing. Yes, but it's just khaki cosplay. I don't know. I don't where does this. It just very like- No, the khaki cosplay comes from spending too much time on sites like 4chan and watching Fox News and Ben Shapiro. Wait, wait, wait. It's getting crowded and all that. Can we roll back a little bit because you feel like they look like stormtroopers at the end there with a look at the knee pads. Hang on. These guys don't have it. Here comes some stormtrooper like yes. I don't is that like well, I want to look tough. I want to wear armor. What do I got? Well, I play a little bit of roller hockey when I was growing up so I got some pads. I don't know. What are they doing? Why are they wearing knee pads? Why do they have to be on their knees so much with other men who represent the original American army? Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Americans and but a lot of knee work. Stop it. You're the worst. You're worse than the Patriot front. I just want to be clear about that leading garbage person for today Francesco Fiorentini. But anyway, I want to show we had a little bit more footage. Actually, can we skip ahead to the third video? Because at some point, I believe this is the video I'm thinking of. There was a clip where I can talk over there. There's a little bit of clash with counter protesters and then they run away and in a very clown car fashion. I think they load into a U-Haul. Do we have that last video? I don't know why they came in U-Hauls. Like there's cars and there's public transportation. But this is not the video that I saw but they all just flee into any U-Hauls and you can see them there. And again, you so nailed it with the khaki cosplay. It's just so you know everything about these people and what they represent. I should tell you a little bit about their history though. So this group used to be called, where is it? It's the Vanguard America, was it called? Yeah, Vanguard America changed their name after a man affiliated with the group murdered a woman at the notorious Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. So yeah, I wanted to note that I saw in response to one of the videos being spread on Twitter. Someone was talking about how we're now just regularly having fascists marching in the Capitol. And this Trump loving woman responded saying, you guys call everything fascism. Why do you do that? But it's not a leap in this case. That's what these people are. So anyway, it's more concerning that we call them fascists than that they launch for the interests of true Americans. By the way, as a guy that has all of the privilege that they have, and all of the privilege that they do, I am a straight white cis male. Can I just say, what do they think that people like us are lacking right now that we need to reclaim? It's all still set up for people like us. But they just have been convinced that no matter how much they have, no matter how much they're given, they're the ones that are truly being ignored, truly being left behind. So when they say that they need to unite for true Americans, what do they mean by that? What would they like to see happen? Marvel is too woke, number one. And Ghostbusters, also. There were women in it. Women in Ghostbusters. My God, wait, Francesca. I'm just reading breaking news in the Hollywood Reporter. Disney is making a sequel to Shang-Chi. That's it. Wow. When is Disney going to give us movies for true Marvel fans? You're right. The wokeness has finally gone too far. Wait, are you excited? Did you just get up in excitement or anger? I am actually excited. I really like the first one I saw twice. But anyway, but it does bother some people. Anyway, yeah, I can't wait to see what's happening. No, I mean, and this is when you don't understand like democratic socialism, basic critiques of capitalism, the importance of unions, like internationalism. You don't study history. You're just so bored with your life and you think, or look, are you Scottish, Irish? Are you Portuguese? Are you any kind of interesting, your family is probably German maybe, like, I don't know. Celebrate, get a get a Stein out and celebrate German heritage, except not the weird part, the spacious part. You know what I'm saying? You could be proud to be where you're from, but don't make it about your whiteness, because that's a construct, bro. And it's also very bad and weird. I just see a lot of boredom. So maybe, I'm eating my words, maybe we need better video games, more interesting video games. Maybe that's the problem. Let's have that. That sounds fine by me. But yeah, it is, no, you're right. It is scary that we, here's the thing. When it's Antifa, or a militant part of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is a very small, small, small portion of it. That takes up, I mean, Fox News, Newsmax, everyone just gets obsessed with that small militant portion of it. But on the other hand, when this happens, nobody really covers it. because it's seemingly below, again, the NBCs, the CNNs, we're not going to cover that. It's just everyday fascism. We have to cover these things, because we've seen the ways. Yeah, this was the group that was responsible or partially responsible for the death of Heather Heyer at the Unite the Right rally. You think it might be important to see what they're up to now under their new names. But that's somehow so beneath a lot of mainstream media outlets, they don't even cover it. You think it might be important? They just stormed the Capitol. Remember that? Remember the Oath Keepers? And the 58th percentile? I don't know what they're called. Remember the one-sixteenth percentile, which is the size of their, it's the, I don't know if it's the whiteness or- I don't know, look, I think, again, covering it, you would then have to talk about who they support, who supports them. It acknowledges too much to really focus on it. I just want to mention one last thing, I'm trying to find it. So here's the issue with some people, when you know that they tweeted something, so the next day you load up their Twitter and it takes you five minutes of scrolling just to get through one day of their tweeting. What is wrong with some people, seriously? Some people's entire life is just being on Twitter. Anyway, so Dinesh D'Souza, where is this damn tweet? I really should have had it ready. Anyway, I'll summarize. So he says that those marchers are not the group that they openly say that they are, that it's a false flag, that they are in fact. Take a closer look. Does this look real to you? Or does this look like a group of federal agents pretending to be right wing extremists? God. So no, but this is what they do now. Everything is Alex Jones, that's why we did the impersonation last week, it's all a false flag. It's literally their group, their leader gave a speech. No, it's feds. It's the FBI, why? Because maybe it makes us look bad? But simultaneously it's good because look at us and we're so organized. Everything is a false flag, everything is Antifa simultaneously. There are no actual conservatives in America. It's just Antifa pretending to be conservative, did you know that? Anyway. I mean, what the funniest part about it is that you see like, you're just jealous of, are you jealous of Antifa? You clearly you're ripping off some other style, giving it your khakis flair, and you're pro fascist, not anti fascist. Or as one brave militia member said, anti, anti, Antifa, anti Antifa, which is the best. The best.
